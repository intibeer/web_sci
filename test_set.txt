Hi Rich.  We don't know why there was no Guardian newspapers in the lounge.  Other passengers may have taken them. ^N
Hello @user I will be flying for work (wife and infant child will be joining on same flight) Can we swap seats during the flight?
It would depend on a few different things, Dave. The crew would be best placed to advise on the day. ^Anthony

Hi Mark, our Customer Relations team work in date order I'm afraid. They'll be in contact shortly. Thanks for your continued patience.^Jo
3xweeks to respond to my reply to your email is pretty poor. Shows exactly how much BA value their customers poor experiences
Sorry for the confusion, Chris. What flights are you trying to book? Are you logged into your Executive Club account?^Corry
Yes logged into exec club. each time I put in flight details, searches for flights & returns an error message saying try again later.
Hi Wayne, we're sorry you feel that way. We've introduced some fantastic offerings like buy on board from M&S. Thanks. ^Raj
If I wanted to eat M&S food, I'd buy it from M&S! BA was one of the few defining airlines that did not charged for F&B, until Veuling cloned

Thank you for the response. I DM the information.
@user I do hope the crew member (I have his picture if you need a clue) has been disciplined at least.  Customer respect/safety and loyalty should be number 1 @user cabin crew who verbally and physically assault should be dismissed.
Sorry you feel this way, Toby. You previously advised we should have honoured the upgrade price you were previously offered. This isn't 1/2
This was a suggestion, I assume you haven't looked into the full details of the complaint. Your customer service is non-existent, full stop.
Hi Jane.  Our Customer Relations team work in date order.  It may take some time before you get a response.  We have to be consistent (1/2)
Definitely consistent - customer service is appalling

@user Hi BA, I'm having trouble requesting my meal choice. I keep getting a 'technical error' message.
We're flying in 29days. I wanted to see if WT+ meal option included veg/fish otherwise I'm stuck with Y class special meal
We're sorry the vegan meal you were given wasn't to our usual standards, Lucy. Please provide your flight number so we can feed this back.
Let's be honest, your standards are extremely low these days. And we won't even start on your non existent customer service. It is dire.
@user defiantly the coolest flight crew onboard BA2602,   ? I'm voting for him !   let's give this guy a few likes !
Your customer service ppl gave us a phone  that was not in service. What a joke. You need to help us now. We lost valuable items
Unbelievably poor service. I hope this gets resolved soon - after two months!

Why does nobody at BA know their own rules and have to pass the buck? Is there nobody that can give a definitive answer?
Hi Mark.  I'm sorry you feel the way you do.  We must be consistent so we're fair to all customers.  We can't push through a reply (1/2)
You can't or will not push through, it's been 10 weeks
Hi David.  Tier Points are only awarded on commercial bookings.  You don't get any rewards for using your Avios to book flights. ^N
Thanks for clarification.
This is correct, I'm afraid you'd need to be travelling on a flight operated by a oneworld member airline. Sorry for any disappointment. ^LS
Isn't British airways a one world member airline?

You've done it before. I have a reservation number.
Appalled with @user Girlfriend who flies with support dog humiliated by flight attndt and announced as an inconvenience. Awful!
Absolutely disgusting. Shame on you @userThanks for reaching out, Chris. What's your flight number?
218 to JFK
With Fall fares on sale, there’s no reason to sit or stay (in town). Just book by 8/16. Blackout dates+Restr.Said "Three seats left", went to instantly book, then says "fare sold out", but still listing as sale price. Was really hoping to get tix :(
Damn. Even @user can't get a plane off the ground on time. Was hopeful for a minute there that I found a functional airline 
While I have some down time... there are so many birds in this @user terminal that bird shit is dripping down the TVs lmaopic.twitter.com/IgWfZtLaax
Horrible digital experience w/ @user No reminder email, mobile boarding pass didn't work. Won't be flying with them again! Sad!
always love when you act like an influencer!
Maybe I need to rethink Delta! I always just fly whatever is cheapest (except NEVER @userHaha I hear you but you also gotta fly safe and invest in yourself. Delta has a great program.
Getting ready to board @user way to start a vacay.. right @user ? These 3 were born readypic.twitter.com/enhZntCXdB
I hope we’re going to Disney World… 
it really stinks that @user allows people who paid more to board flights before families with children under 2. Flying with babies is not easy. Corporations like @user should put families before "first class" passengers. It's not a huge sacrifice.
Yes, we do see it's been further delayed and we know you've been so patient. Were you able to get the meal voucher offered?
Yeah, the $8 voucher. Doesn't quite make up for what will most likely end up being a 5 hour delay
@user @user @user @user  someone help this poor man before it's too late!! He's just a rookie flyer!
Not a rookie merely a seasoned vet disappointed in @user and their nonsense
Jay, sounds like a frustrating morning. We'll look into it and get back to you as soon as we have new info to share.

Sorry for the delay today. We'll get you in the air as soon as we can.
We even wanted to change to another American Airline flight but now must stay home and take the loss. Sad. Loss of a customer.
We've received your DMs and will respond shortly. Thanks for your patience.
I'm getting there. I travel almost weekly, and can't afford for nearly 70% of my flights to have issues.
That's not a pattern we'd care to keep, Adam. We'll do our best to turn things around, so this doesn't continue to happen.
Hi @user I confess I haven't flown w/ you much but just had an *incredible* flight from MCI to LGA. Perfect start to our trip!
Thanks for giving us another shot, Katy. We look forward to many more AAwesome trips together!

Can you meet us in DMs with the email address you used along with the reference number starting in 1 - (if you received one)?
No they were checked baggage with 8 other 50lb boxes of fish. Those 8 arrived and these 2 did not. All were checked at the same exact time.
Please reach out to our Baggage team: They can provide any updates for you.
@user - Love having the app tell me the baggage claim  and that my bags were offloaded at my arriving airport!
We love that you love it, Clay!
@user does not care for their consumers well-being. It is laughable and they will definitely not get my business again. We do care about you, Sarah. What has you so upset today?
Just not enough to offer an apology.
Believe us, we never want delays to happen as we know you have places you need to be. We're sorry for the inconvenience yesterday.
I'm extremely disappointed in my previous interaction via DM and would like to speak to a rep, ideally. Thank you!
We're a team that works via Twitter. We're sorry that you're unhappy with our resolution, but we have the final say on these matters.
The least I expect is for airline staff to be eligible to enter Canada before being allocated to service a flight to Canada @userOur apologies for the delay. We know how important your time is, and we see you should be in the air shortly.
Furthermore @user has to be the crappiest airline with the worst customer service.
If we can help in anyway, then please let us know.

This is what we're going for, Ashley! We'll see you in the air again soon.

@user but what is this?pic.twitter.com/gHTeRn3Ebh

Had a problem with my @user reservation and they fixed it right away and upgraded my seat. @user should take notes. We apologize for the delay yesterday, Garrett. If need help with anything else, then please let us know via DM.
@user wow super "new" aircraft... no lavs, no water... even @user has lavs... We're going to get this over to the right team for a quick fix. For documentation purposes, did you let the crew know?
I messaged you in DM, waiting for response.
We're taking a look at it now. Give us a moment and we'll send you a response there.
That doesn’t help @user my meeting is at 12:30 at JFK

@user what is the best email to use to file a complaint? Thank you!
You would just DM us here. Feel free to treat that format as an email, as there is no character limit.

We know it's frustrating to miss a flight. Let us know if you'd like some help with rebooking.
Sent you the baggage tag numbers. But how do you think we can manage staying in Amazon without our meds,jackets and another essentials?
The bag is expected to be on flight AA2529 connecting to AA972 to LIM.
Thank you @user for allowing active-duty military w/ ID to board early. You bet! We love our military and appreciate everything you do for us.
@user plane was late (late plane daily in DBQ bc of AA over scheduling), then 2 switched planes, missed connection by 2 minutes.
Can you please meet us in DMs, and confirm your record locator?
Second time in a few weeks that @user cancels the 8:30am DCA-BOS flight at last second. Not good. We don't like to cancel flights, Guy. We're so sorry for the changes to your plans. Do you need help with rebooking?
@user is trash. Literally so done with them. 
We strive to always be the best! Let us know what happened so we can try to turn this around.

@user , today is the last day to change the time of my train, I have been triying since 9:00 without results. very disappointing!
could you send the details (reference code or email address) to us in DM? Happy to check that out right away. :)
... So what can I do? Who can I call?
oh no!  Sorry to hear that! Can you send us a DM with your booking reference so we can look into this together? Thanks
But still, there's an error in pricing. In your website the price is 73.60 and in SNCB's page it's 40.80 for 4 people...
We can’t always offer the base price on SNCB's site and we don’t have access to some promo fares. See our FAQ page:I was looking for the 10.28h one, which in the web doesn't exist.... At the official site I get one to 10.08h that doesn't appear on the app
I also don't see a departure at 10:28, and we can't offer the 10:08 because it includes that local bus for which we can't sell tickets.
we can't offer a few of those journeys (e.g. 6:01 or 8:01 departures), because they include a local bus that we cannot sell tickets for. 1/2
But you should find that the timetables otherwise match the operator’s website. :) 2/2

Here's a long weekend plan for Paris -I can't download my train tickets it says they have already been downloaded and there on my old phone :(

There is no information, no support, no number to call... We asked around but nobody could tell us where we could catch this "ghost" bus
... So what can I do? Who can I call?
Hello @user our bus from Villeneuve-de-Berg Centre to Montélimar never showed up, so we missed our trains to Lyon & Paris...

You can plan your journey via the following link to see all services available to you.Having worst 24 hours of my life, & a @user employee at Liverpool Street's inability to have manners has sent me over the edge
Sorry to hear this Ellie, we don't have any staff members at stations I'm afraid.
Sure. Are there touch points inside the station/on platforms anywhere or just at the main entrance?
These are usually located at the main entrance.
@user 3 times in the last two weeks the 8:21 from Levenshulme has stopped at Oxford Rd for 20+ mins for no reason. Infuriating.
I'm so sorry about this, @user maybe able to advise why these were delayed.
@user Hi, I commute from Colchester into London Liverpool Street - how long will the disruption last?   Hi there, the disruption is expected until the end of service.
Thanks you very muvh
You're welcome.
How? So I have to continue trying to find a member of staff every time I need to get through barriers? Not v convenient!
If you visit the ticket office, they maybe able to activate the card again or swap it for you.

@user nationalrailenq⁠ I'm on delayed cross country train nuneaton to Leicester - will I make 11.26 East Midlands train to Barrow-upon-soar???
Hi there, the train is scheduled to arrive at Leicester at 11:26.
Can I pay the excess? I didn't realise Oxford parkway was before Oxford :/
Yes this is no problem at all, you can either purchase before hand or on the train.
Last time i used the service it was delayed by more than an hour, therefore i recieved vouchers, but in the end have made no saving!!!
I'm sorry to hear this, you would need to contact the train operator you travelled with regarding this and they would offer compensation.
Many thanks.
You're welcome.
Okay great, thank you
You're welcome.
Does anyone know if trains are running normally yet?    Hi there, delays of up to 10 minutes can be expected until 12:00 on this route.
@user I couldn't travel yesterday so my travelcard was accepted on SWT today but not on the LU. Is this correct?pic.twitter.com/iPfmLeaLOB
Hi there, the ability to use your ticket today is only valid on South West Trains services. Sorry for any inconvenience.
Yes - was told my phone may cause this (?) but when I said my phone & ticket are never together, they said they didn't know. V frustrating!
I'm so sorry about this, it is possible that the card has de-activated at some point causing it to stop working.
That is why I need to change via Woking and havantpic.twitter.com/57lRvBAQnH

@user FlightsDelays UK 01513758765 just advised me that you sold them my personal data including phone number.
Hi Rebecca, This is concerning to read, did you speak to this company over the phone ? ^Oli
HI Johnny, We are currently experiencing high call volumes, is there anything I can help with? ^Lucy
Just tried to again but apparently the offices are closed even though the automated message says it shuts at 5:30! Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
It's a standard response mate I've seen it all over their timeline. I'm so worried about my 2 year old but hubby refuses to pay nearly £100!
Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
And then on here.... aim to! What does that even mean.
I see you eventually got your reply not that it's much use as they don't give a straight answer. It's the same reply to everybody 
Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
Hi Ron, What is it we can help you with ? ^Oli
@user @user of your directors call me , this is a complete joke
So you'd expect a 4 year old to sit next to another family...... impressive customer service!!
I see you eventually got your reply not that it's much use as they don't give a straight answer. It's the same reply to everybody 
That phone line has been busy for the past week! You have changed/downgraded our hotel accommodation and didn’t even tell us!
And changed our flights to a different day and charged us more for the extra leg room seats!
HI Johnny, We are currently experiencing high call volumes, is there anything I can help with? ^Lucy
That phone line has been busy for the past week! You have changed/downgraded our hotel accommodation and didn’t even tell us!
You even sent me an email last night at 19.02 saying "7 days to go, time to check in online" WHY ? So is check in full or not working ?
I can't check in with Thomson either  flying tomz!
Hi Rebecca, If you're travelling on a Thomson Airways flight one bag cannot exceed 23kgs ^Jodie
Thanks for your reply. Do you know if I can use my Visa card for hotel towel deposits and also the tourist tax?
Hi, This would be down to availability. ^Oli
So you'd expect a 4 year old to sit next to another family...... impressive customer service!!
Hi Emma, If you were to cancel you're booking it would be under our normal Terms And Conditions. ^Oli
Surely by selling holidays to hotels you know to be unsafe you are breaching your T&Cs yourself?
Hi Claire, As this is a complimentary service this can close at anytime. You will need to check in at the airport ^C
So I should have waited up until 00.01to be in with a chance of checking in online & what I was told about there being an issue was rubbish
Hi Steph, Do you currently have a booking with us ? ^Oli
No just looking at the moment but will have a infant travelling
Hi Gareth, Have you discussed this with your rep? ^Clark
No, I'm not sure he can make the building work cease for 2 weeks. Surely you appreciate this is not what we were looking for when we booked?
HI Harjinder, How can I help with the email conformation? ^Lucy
As well as passports
HI Harjinder, How can I help with the email conformation? ^Lucy
Do I just need to take the email confirmation to the airport, as online checking isn't working for my flight?
Hi Gary, How can I help? ^Lucy
Just a bit worried about the bad reviews about bellevue minerva  I keep reading
Hi Janet, Are you trying to pay off your balance through Manage My Booking? ^Clark
Got through to call centre, apparently debit card not valid. Crap call centre, crap IT. Needs updating
@user @userI think we depart from Croatia on the 24th
Hi Peter, Do you get an error message when you attempt to check in online ? ^Oli
Yes i do get and error.pic.twitter.com/5cokcAEVEJ
@user @user 1 month(book time) not enough time to action, not hard? Given price paid for holiday? 2/2   Guessing @user @user is away on holiday too Hi Russ, I apologise for the inconvenience we are currently experiencing high call volumes. ^Lucy
Right!  That's it, you've now broken your own 28 day SLA! You owe me £66!  I'll issue a CCJ against your company director to get this back!
Hi, Our check in staff will be able to assist further with this and reallocate where needed ^Clark
So we defiantly will be together??
@user our son renamed your plane to Nightmare Liner instead of Dream Liner. Rows of 3 seats but won't sit a family of 3 together!
Were you asked to pay extra to sit next to your child? 

If so, please  the petition and  my pinnedHi Nat, What's your Pre Travel complaint in regards to ? ^Oli
And get an explanation for the disgraceful customer service
Hi Nat, What's your Pre Travel complaint in regards to ? ^Oli
After four hours with a small baby in your store, repeated stalling and trips across the road to Waterstones to feed etc I want to complain
Hi Nat, What's your Pre Travel complaint in regards to ? ^Oli
Thomson all of a sudden would no longer honour that. We have the cash back in the end and have rebooked our holiday online however
Hi Natalie, We would advise speaking with our dedicated After Travel team regarding this ^Clark
I have done, as previously mentioned  on my last tweet...the one you just replied to?
Hi Nat, What's your Pre Travel complaint in regards to ? ^Oli
We cancelled our wedding/holiday and had 400 on account. We're advised we could use Thai for honeymoon when time came to book honeymoon
Hi Olivia, Can you confirm this number so we can check this for you ^Clark
Re: Reference Olivia Ford Booking Ref No0342/39872 [2389345-1502882734]
Hi Janet, Are you trying to pay off your balance through Manage My Booking? ^Clark
Part of it yes
Hi, If flying with Thomson Airways you would have 5kg hand luggage ^Clark
Cheers for that. My god that's light.
Hi Ron, What is it we can help you with ? ^Oli
I am not going to keep repeating myself.   Please refer to my emails and other tweets
Hi, Can you please emal cares@thomson.co.uk with your reference. ^Lucy
Hi Lucy I actually received it this morning :) thx. It is written that when its a honeymoon we have a gift, how can I advise it is one?
Hi Richard, As you're currently on holiday you'll need to contact serviceUK@tui-ds.com. ^Oli
I'm not on holiday - I've returned and just received my cc bill- hence this ! I was not aware of charge that I was made to pay in airport.
Hi Dave, This flight is a Dreamliner. Please bear in mind all aircraft's are subject to change. ^Katie
Everything changes once they've received your full payment  Hi Corrina, Can you email cares@thomson.co.uk with your reference and details and we can look into this for you ^Lucy
Thank you I have sorted it now
@user Fabulous Aegean cruise however...Kids in adult pool and cannot get a 2018 brochure to book for next year in reception 
Surely on a sales point of view those brochures should be EVERYWHERE!
Hi Mike, Please can you email cares@thomson.co.uk with further details to look into this for you ^Jodie
Sent. Please call
Hi Jason, You'll need to email WeddingsSalesenquiries@thomson.co.uk. ^Oli
Thank you Oli. You may need to update your contact us page.
Will they change our seats when we check in then?
And also why would they allocate us 4 different seats across 8 rows?!! Human error?
Hi Gary, We do throughout the year continually review the quality and standards of all our Resorts. ^Oli
Ok just worried because of all the bad reviews
Hi David, Are you currently in resort? ^Luke
In case you are still there we're just boarding two hours after original departure time
Hi, Please visit one of our retail stores and they will be able to offer advise and quotes for you. ^Brenda
We don't have one where I live anymore. Google it is!
Hi Peter, Once the check in allocation has been reached the remaining passengers. ^Oli
Thanks Oli but I do not understand why some passengers can check in but others cannot on the same flight.
Hi Claire, Our online check in would be full, therefore you need to check in at the airport. ^Rebecca
Why ????? Why is it full at 8am on the day it opened? Why was I told it wasn't working and problem with all online check in ????????
Hi Johm, All aircraft's are only planned and not confirmed as this can change for operational reasons ^Clark
so 4 flights sold as dreamliner, and not one of them actually a dreamliner, am I unlucky or are they really that unreliable??
Hi Kirstie, We never guarantee that online check in will be available for every package ^Clark
May I also advise your WEBSITE is also incorrect. This is not good enough and I will be taking this matter further. Lie after lie. No help.
Hi, We would aim to keep children under 12 next to at least one adult on the booking under the CAA guidelines. ^Brenda
Will they change our seats when we check in then?
Hi Kirstie, We never guarantee that online check in will be available for every package ^Clark
Not true!Another fob off.I suggest you amend all documentation you send to customers advising this is possible and when.It is a lie!
Hi Natalie, If you are unhappy with the response you will need to continue to liaise with the After Travel Team. ^Katie
No excuses for next time. Sent this complaint off yesterday (recorded delivery AGAIN). Proof so you lot can't lie to me again Hi Olivia, Did you receive an automatic ticket number from the email you sent to us? ^Rebecca
Yes
Hi, These can take up to 24 hours to be received. Please also check your junk/spam folder in case it goes in there ^Jo
How can I find out my hand luggage allowance for my flight? Ta
Hi David, Are you currently in resort? ^Luke
Nope stuck at MAH where we have been since 0923 (local) when the inbound flight was still on the ground in the UK
Hi Rachael, The online check in can close before or after the one week to departure mark ^Luke
Point still stands that the only way to guarantee online check in is to prepay for seats therefore not complimentary.
Hi Lee, If you could please email cares@thomson.co.uk we can look into this for you ^Luke
Wow common sense has disappeared! I just want an update from the chase up of my vouchers
Disgusting, bad enough you had to complain at all but their customer service is appalling!
10 weeks later and numerous phone calls. Replacement suitcases have finally arrived. All I need is a response to my complaint Peter James Long, David Burling, Jeremy Ellis, Garry Wilson @user @user  someone please contact me don't ignore me
david.burling@thomson.co.uk as well as other directors emails no one answers
Hi Kate, Please email cares@thomson.co.uk so we can look into this for you ^Luke
We have been emailing you on that address almost every day for the last 4.5 months. But there's still no answer or update on our case.
Hi Andy, I'm sorry to hear about this. Did you raise your concerns at the airport? ^Luke
It was more the fact that it would've been clear that it was broken and the lack of care at which it would've been loaded.
Hi Andy, I'm sorry to hear about this. Did you raise your concerns at the airport? ^Luke
I tried Luke, but to be honest, the Greek staff at the Airport weren't too bothered & the Thomson staff were loading return passengers.
Hi, I've already booked our hotel through you but flights separately. Now just need transfers to and from the airport each way.
Hi - are you able to help??
@user sent a flight delay claim over 2 months ago and no response after the specified '56' days, am i ever going to get a reply?
Ellie, if the airline denies compensation, we may be able to help you! > ^Andrea
Hi, As we work on a live pricing system the prices of our flights and holidays can fluctuate frequently ^Luke
Thanks for the update but your still pulling punters pants down.. Hi Alex, You will need to contact Thomas Cook for a confirmation email. ^Katie
Surely I would get a receipt from you, in the form of a confirmation email of my purchase?
Hi Alex, You will need to contact Thomas Cook for a confirmation email. ^Katie
Hi Katie, why would I need to contact Thomas Cook for a confirmation email? I reserved my seats for the flight separately and paid you so
Hi, Its a complementary service and may not be available for all flights. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. ^Brenda
Then why promise it?I have had 3 excuses now, that I can only get it if I pay more, IT issue and now this.I am being lied to and fobbed off.
Hi Deborah, You can get an update on the progress by calling this team on 0203 451 2699 ^Brenda
Thank you Brenda. It's a pity some1 didn't relay any of that information at the time of our delay. I appreciate you for giving me your time.
Hi Clare, You can email us at cares@thomson.co.uk ^Luke
Thank you.
Hi Lee, I have chased for the voucher for you today. For your records your ticket reference is CO-424623 ^Brenda

85k women per yr in England & Wales are raped.15% of those who experience sexual violence report it. We have a problem w/ men raping women.

No idea but out of 3 in my new flat only the 1 in his bedroom works. Been with @user for 1 month. Not a happy bunny
Sorry to hear that. Are the order due to get back to you with an update on this? ^Shane
We have had no communication from you-  just @user notifying there has been 'a delay' from your end. When will this be resolved? .@bt_uk
@user called on 19/07 to cancel contract on 01/09 and you've increased my bill, charing cancellation fee and making me pay until 14/09???

Great to hear! Thank you! @user.@bt_uk I am concerned that I've been in my new house 4 weeks now & there are STILL no lines installed despite assurances there would be. 
"Be There" is the new motto from BT in their adverts; except in your case, Carly, they are not !!!  "Beware" would be a better motto ...
The @user advert always gets me tearing up. Love you pops

@user why don't u offer a proper loyalty scheme? Just get people to extend 12 month / 18 month contracts in return for discount etc
(2/2) But it's an interesting suggestion that we'll definitely pass on to the Sky VIP team
@user why don't u offer a proper loyalty scheme? Just get people to extend 12 month / 18 month contracts in return for discount etc

Thanks for the tickets to see @user V @user @user  @user Not a bad way to spend an evening. That is a wonderful way to spend a Thursday. What a good thing the game was yesterday rather than on Wednesday 
Great experience with @user - loyalty mattered. Normal wait time 30 mins, VIP wait time 2 mins. Friendly UK staff who exceeded expectations
Great to hear that we could sort everything for you so quickly, Ian. How are you liking Sky VIP so far?
free movie, free sky go, free set ups and now 40% off for 18 months. DEAL!
Welcome to Sky VIP, Alastair. So glad to see you're already enjoying the rewards on offer - there will be a lot more to come as well

Great work Howell. Are you excited about Ray Donovan coming back? @user let us know if you've got any Sky VIP questions at all
yes, all signed up thanks. Just wish I'd known sooner!!!
Well now that you're signed up, make sure that you check the My Sky app regularly for new updates & rewards
You kept that quiet @user Hey Sheryl, have you been able to sign up to Sky VIP? Let us know if you need any help getting registered
Sky VIP is fine, but they need more offers for those living in Ireland. Soccer AM & Premier League tickets aren't much use to us overseas..
We'll be releasing new rewards all the time through but that's good to know. We'll make sure we pass your feedback on to the team
So I thought I was lucky having Sky VIP Silver status. My parents are Black level. Ugh.
Well the longer you're with us, the better Sky VIP gets. Hopefully you'll be able to get the same rewards as your parents soon 
@user Excellent work from your engineer Martyn today to get us back up and running.

Even told me about   and I signed up.
Great to hear that you're back up & running and that you've signed up to Sky VIP! Have you started redeeming your rewards?

Who likes their internet deal and who is it with as I'm with @user and it's dog shit
Switching to virgin was the worst thing I ever did! I cannot wait to go back to @user in October! They are referring to Openreach. Your provider would contact openreach on your behalf. We do the same for BT customers.  ^Shane
But @user can't provide a date surely I should be assigned a case manager @user this stage?We are paying for a service! .@bt_uk .@BTCare
We have had no communication from you-  just @user notifying there has been 'a delay' from your end. When will this be resolved? .@bt_uk

Sopranos Box Sets S1-6 are available on demand now. How’s that for an offer you can’t refuse?Is this coming back? Started watching it last week & it has now vanished.
Some of us have jobs to do so can't sit on the app all day some kind on notification would be good  @userBeen checking everyday for a week at least every 15/20 mins completely sold out. Dodgy this

Their bundle is also far cheaper and offers more than @user They've given me VIP status yet can't offer the products as a result! Jokers
Sounds worth a try. When Virgin works it's good, when it's broken you're on your own though.
Hi mate, good thanks. I use Virgin but would never recommend them as their service is terrible. You moved house or something?
Their bundle is also far cheaper and offers more than @user They've given me VIP status yet can't offer the products as a result! Jokers
After reading  I've been looking forward to watching the TV series. Why aren't all the episodes still available @userThey will be on 4od surely?

Hi there.  What was the refund for? Have you received the money back now? What happened? DM us@user hi, I'm on O2 contract, how much to use my phone/contract in Turkey please?
Hi Steve, you can use O2 Travel for £3.99 per day in Turkey. More info here >I've done that now and changed tariffs :) no way I can get the money back from my bolt ons from this month?
Ah, we're glad you've been able to do that!  We wouldn't be able to refund the money for a bolt-on that was already applied.
The signal round here isn't actually strong enough to load it. It's only around EC2 as soon as I go even to old street things start loading!

I can't get 4G in Italy, 3G is as slow as E never had it this bad    @userHi there. We don't currently have a 4G roaming agreement in Europe. Have you tried manually selecting alternative networks?

 Have you spoken directly with our upgrades team about your options? Are you running out of data each month currently?
So I upgrade my tariff and @user  decide to remove my discount. Having a laugh if they think I'm paying £62.00 phone bill
 Any discounts do automatically get removed when a new upgrade is processed, as you're taking out a new deal.
I haven't received a number @user said I should receive my parcel 15th Aug but it never came and I didn't get an email from you.
We've replied to your DM Charlotte.

Thanks! Will do
No worries :-) NB
A blockage that was there on 13/7. They claim work commenced 29/7 and will take x weeks. No groundwork to my home yet either

Sorry you feel that way, Jordan. ^CC

Hi Sarah, I'm very sorry for any inconvenience this work is causing. We will get this completed as quickly as possible. LB

Have the team given a reason as to why there is a delay with this? NB

Welcome on board Gavin. :) If you need anything just give us a shout. LB
@user hi our remotes not working properly how do i go about getting a new one? Ive had it since i got virgin so around 5+ years
Hello Matthew, thank you for your tweet. If you call the team on 150/0345 454 1111 they'll be happy to order one ...Your very good at not taking any responsibility! Fuck it that's it 
We are unable to empty the bins for you, you would need to contact the council so they can arrange for these to be emptied. NB
@user We are sadly moving to an area that Virgin Media doesn't cover. Can you confirm I'm out of contract and how much notice u need?
Oh no, that is a shame. :( We would require 30 days notice for any cancellation. Our team on 150 / 0345 454 1111 ...I didn't follow well, thought your colleague reduced the bill to £1.72, then received PDF back to £17. Struggled to understand her English.
Was the bill received the same day as you had the conversation Mike? If a credit is applied after the bill has be...None at all. Even an engineer couldn't work out the issue
Have you had an engineer visit about this recently Paul? LB
Please read back what you said it makes no sense FML why did i leave @userIf the engineer has requested for the equipment to be activated it may not fully activate for up to 24 hours. NB
It didn't. It's running a test on my home, if it's still not working, phone back in 10 mins. No option to speak to a person
It would run this test first Duncan, if you give our team another call it will let you speak with an advisor. LB
Yes. Getting between 35 & 38mb when promised 100mb
Are there any issues listed on our service page that could account for this: LB
I keep being told 4-6 weeks - I've alreAdy waited longer than that
Apologies for this, what have our team advised regarding this when you spoke with them last? NB
The link take me to a test page... not a page I can get a quicker appointment
When did you speak to the team, was it today? ^CC
no agents for online chat, phone line won't even ring and no email address. How do I contact you @userSorry to hear that. The phone line should always ring. what number are you dialling? ^CC
Engineer installed everything at 12.00 and before leaving said everything was activated and running fine
He may have activated the equipment however it can take up to 24 hours for it to fully activate. NB
When do the new beefed up compensation arrangements take effect?
Sorry to hear that, have you spoken to a member of our faults team regarding this? They can be reached at 0345 454 1111. ^CC
Ahhhh my bad! I hope @user can help

The wifi will not connect to the server and it's being very temperamental :(
Are there any issues listed on our service page that could account for this: LB
Fuck the council there all bent ! Your the problem leaving the street in this mess
This is something we would not be able to arrange i'm afraid. NB

Apologies for this. We do aim to get faults fixed by the estimated time. Our team will be working hard to ensure this is the case. ^Ben
It's automated, I need to speak to someone, a system test is pretty useless
If you follow the option for TV technical help it will give you the option to speak with an advisor once you run ...Yes but the internet is not working, they said they cant see anything wrong on there side
When was the equipment activated as it can take up to 24 hours for it to activate. NB
Not even getting half of the internet speed promised to me
Are you having issues on both a wired and wireless connection? LB
Already done everything you'll  ask
Are you having trouble with a wired connection as well? ^Ben
For me it's the download speed and wifi coverage.! Really poor like being in the 1990's. Old TV box that takes ages to get catch up Tv.
Are you getting these speed issues via a wired or wireless connection? NB
Then you need to reeducate your customer service team as to what they should be telling customers.
Apologies if this is what you have been advised. NB
I have. But I'm paying you. So, i think you owe me an apology as well.
I am very sorry about this and that this happened to you. Are you able to advise what has happened, just so I can understand PJ. CD
No I didn't realise I needed to so I didn't do it until I'd left.
Are calls and texts working? ^MK
Yes but not good enough its been 4hrs since engineer came to install equipment
Has the equipment been activated? NB
Happy to do that but surely I can’t just remove all of your hardware? Don’t I have to leave something of yours in place to be in modem mode?
i would advise having a look at our forums for further information from our technical experts regarding this NB
Gantoh
Bit confused with your last response HP ^GT
Yes thanks works but will try when I get home
Okay, we're here if you need us. ^MK
I'd rather make a mess of your car park like u have my street 
If you do wish to have this resolved the council will be the best bet to have this resolved. NB
So so many times and I am just told the service is down and will b repaired in .... hrs etc.
When was the last time you called us? ^GT
I had an engineer booked for Tuesday and YOU cancelled him! Supposedly a network fault.  I'm now another 3 days waiting
The link is there if there is an opportunity to move the date earlier. ^CC
Have been promised compensation. It'll need to be good to keep me as a customer. Nearing the final straw with this.
We wouldn't offer compensation only a loss of service credit as per our credit guidelines NB
Spoke to someone on the phone who left me baffled. Which is why I'd prefer e-mail or chat. Even direct message here would be ok.
We don't have access to the DM facility I'm afraid, what did they advise you during the call Mike? RP
can i like pay money for it to go faster?
i know it's lame, but internet is like the most important thing to me
It may be that the connections we need are locked away and the flat manager would be the only person with access ^GT
When you get an email from @user about a price increase when they can't even fulfil what they promise Hi Paul, I can appreciate that a price increase is never welcome news. Are you having issues with the services at the moment? LB
@user its taken 4hrs since switching over from @user to call about my internet not working, Friday is the quickest for callout 
I'm sorry to hear this Edson, has this engineer visit been booked for you now then? NB
@user Hey, my internet and tv is down and the status page says everything's good?
Hi there. Sorry to hear this. How long have you been having this issue? ^Ben
my phone and I don't see why I should have to waste my phone data navigating your website I pay you to provide me not the other way around
The site is there to provide you with information if there is an outage as well as do some diagnostics if that is needed. ^CC
dont worry...
No problem Connor, if there is anything we can help with just let us know. LB
Yes, already spent ages on phone to VM today
Thankyou ^GT
That was totally pointless. Made me do a hard reset and now have to set everything back up with and still have the same issue.
Thanks for calling Carl, what did our team advise we can do moving forward to get this sorted since the hard reset didn't work? LB
Each time it was 'escalated' to the highways team to get the pipe put in, but obviously not as I had over an hours worth of calls today
Very sorry to hear this Matt. Have the guys who came arranged for the additional work to be completed before the next appointment? ^MK
@user is the worst.!! @user has had bad experiences with virgin.!! Virgin service in Bristol is very very poor.!!
I'm sorry to hear you feel that way James, are you able to elaborate on your issue so we can assist? NB
I'm already getting them. I spoke to tech support yesterday. See my earlier email about their nonsense reason for the outage.
If there are any further updates we will keep you notified via text. NB
@user If I want to use modem mode and utilise my own router, do you offer a smaller piece of hardware as an alternative to Hub 3.0?
Hi there Gareth, we don't unfortunately. You would need to purchase this. NB

You can opt to have text notifications set up if you are able to give our team a call. NB
@user your @user people lied to me. How do I complain.
Hi, thanks for your post. I am very sorry to hear this. You would have to log that complaint with Yodel, may I ask you what has happened. CD
I will check when I get back home. Thanks for your help with this.
No worries, let us know if you need anything else. NB
My virgin media broadband? Thank you
Hello Billy, sorry to hear of the broadband issues you're experiencing. If you could elaborate we're here to help. RP
I was told Virgin would be contacting them in the next couple of days (I'd appreciate it if that could be asap, really).
We will be working as fast as we can to get this sorted Richard. ^GT
@user 43 minutes on the phone, transferred 5 times and still couldn't help me! YOU ARE A JOKE
Oh no! Sorry to hear this Adam. What was it you were calling for? ^MK
@user can you send me a quote for removing a VMcable, stating your call-out charge? Need it written & it's not stated on your website
Hi Amy, you would have to ring the customer service team to arrange this, they can be reached at 0345 454 1111. ^CC
U fucking ring um I've tried loads !
Maybe when there's rubbish in your car park u might do something 
If you contact the council they can arrange the binmen to come tomorrow. NB
Basically hub 3 software not fully functional, as known, but no attempts to rectify this. Customer Issues not important it seems.
Very sorry about this Charlie, we'd always aim to offer the best service we can. ^AR
Yes it is a home landline
Would you be okay to call us please 0345 454 1111 ^GT
Argh! Just received the annual @user bill price hike letter. Will be switching before that comes in. Too much for poor performance.

How are you communicating to us now? ^CC
@user who do I speak to about keeping my current deal without it doubling in price next month or I'm switching to @user ?
You can speak to us for prices that won't double Steph ^GT
Thanks  bloody Virgin Media for writing to tell me you're increasing my monthly bill again!!
Sorry about that Howard, we wouldn't if we didn't have to. ^MK
A big huge massive thank u to Anna at the Welwyn Garden branch of @user she's just changed my life!
That's amazing Molly, can you elaborate so we can pass this on to Anna? RP

No worries, hope it gets sorted for you. NB
ThAts better...old school turn off and on again!pic.twitter.com/7i4E7zwQpM
Hi Lynne, let me know if this is the case this morning? ^RF
Still no service was told it was planned maintenance in the area on Monday today have been told there's been no maintence in the area !!!!
Have you been able to escalate this with our team as per our complaints code of practice? NB
Yesterday I was offered to have it escalated. Rajive said he'd send some emails on 2/8. Don't think he did as he wouldn't take my calls.
I had the new SuperHub fitted and its range is worse than the old one. Devices keep disconnecting, happening for 6 months.
They told me to connect to only 2g as the 5g is not a good connection, and 2g reaches a wider range. They were right, been fab since 
Ah, hopefully the business team will be able to get this resolved for you. ^Ben
basically just pied you off to a different team again, good work
Hey Sean, I'm sorry to hear this. Are you due to be moving the services over to your new address or are you looki...New address and potential new customer! One of your advisors already mentioned something about a capacity lock until maybe mid September

Hi, thanks for your post. I am very sorry to hear this. You would have to log that complaint with Yodel, may I ask you what has happened. CD
Plus your customer service in raising a complaint is bad. It's also costing money. When did you start doing delivery and customer service
Hey Sean, looks like you're in the UK our friends @user should be able to assist.  ^Lindsey
Ahhhh my bad! I hope @user can help 
Thanks for trying that. It would be best to give our team a call on 150 / 0345 454 1111 so that we can look into this further. LB
It's automated, I need to speak to someone, a system test is pretty useless
Hi there. Sorry to hear this. How long have you been having this issue? ^Ben
It's been a couple of hours, it says on the status page that there's a engineer on their way and that it will be fixed at 8:20 tonight
The site is there to provide you with information if there is an outage as well as do some diagnostics if that is needed. ^CC
missing the point it should cost me to find out why and how long my services are down plus it proves how poor your customers services are
Has the equipment been activated? NB
Yes but the internet is not working, they said they cant see anything wrong on there side
I'm sorry to hear you feel that way James, are you able to elaborate on your issue so we can assist? NB
For me it's the download speed and wifi coverage.! Really poor like being in the 1990's. Old TV box that takes ages to get catch up Tv.
We wouldn't offer compensation only a loss of service credit as per our credit guidelines NB
Then you need to reeducate your customer service team as to what they should be telling customers.
Hi Paul, I can appreciate that a price increase is never welcome news. Are you having issues with the services at the moment? LB
Not even getting half of the internet speed promised to me
Was it this link you were trying? ^KT
Yes thanks works but will try when I get home
I'm sorry to hear this Edson, has this engineer visit been booked for you now then? NB
Yes but not good enough its been 4hrs since engineer came to install equipment
If you contact the council they can arrange the binmen to come tomorrow. NB
I'd rather make a mess of your car park like u have my street 
Hi there Gareth, we don't unfortunately. You would need to purchase this. NB
Happy to do that but surely I can’t just remove all of your hardware? Don’t I have to leave something of yours in place to be in modem mode?
If there are any further updates we will keep you notified via text. NB
Have been promised compensation. It'll need to be good to keep me as a customer. Nearing the final straw with this.
Hi Erin, sorry about this. Did you activated your roaming on your account before leaving the UK as well as on your handset? ^KT
No I didn't realise I needed to so I didn't do it until I'd left.Yes I am. I
Would you please DM your service address so that I can take a look at your equipment? - NS

Hi Ruben, you will need to manually select a Greek network. Do you know how to do that? If not, what phone do you have please? -CT
Thanks, but I don't want to upgrade. I was led to believe I could leave my contract without cost after 12 months. Incorrect it seems.
I want to reassure you we would never deliberately give misleading information and if you'd like to raise this further, drop us a DM. -ED
@user could you lovely people DM me please, thanks!
Hi Louis, of course :) -JD
There's no dial tone at all. I'm trying to sort out my roaming abroad in the states but 150 isnt working for me :(

No, I don't have the activity app open during the run.  I just have it on the main screen, don't touch it and only open NRC from phone. (1/2
Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
I don't quite care so much about the bad logging, but I do want to look at my watch during a run and see my stats, while hearing Coach
Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
Is there a particular sequence I need to start a coach run in, if I have both watch and phone with me?
Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?

Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
The runs in NRC looked how they did in the Apple Activity log, however, I was able to delete the wrong log in there to clean it up.
Thank you for the screenshots. Just to clarify, are your phone and watch synced via Bluetooth?
Yes
You're only able to apply runs to the current week of your Coach plan. Let us know if we can assist with anything else.
Thats great, thank you 
Select the run in Activities> click on edit> click on my plan> apply it to the schedule in your Coach plan> save. How'd it go?
It worked thank you! Had no idea I could do that, I couldn't add last weeks but can do it from now on. Appreciate your speedy support cheers
Good question, Varina. No news at this time. We'll be sure to pass this feedback over to our team.
you've already said that about passing it on to the team, I want to know the progress. Let me know this week please.
Thanks for the info. When you finished your runs, were you able to tag and rate them?
Yes, they are tracking in my Activity page but not against my plan in My Coach
Thanks for passing that over. Let's have you log out of the NRC app> restart your device> log back in. Success?
Perfect, thank!!

IT JUST ARRIVED! 
I'd like a member of our team to personally look into this. Please send us your details here: ^VS

Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!

That they didn't know whàt had happened and driver not answering phone 
Hey there, please reach out to us via: and we will have this checked for you. ^KS
Still haven't received. No word from @user no call. What's happening, guys?  on PS4. Went to the store. It's sold out everywhere so had to return and repurchase on your site.
Got it - I hope the next one comes in perfect condition! ^Heidi
Can @user bill be paid with a Discover CC?
Hey - You might want to double check with @user but typically we would accept cash or a check in stores. ^Heidi
so the best thing would be to go back to the store?
Which platform did you purchase that for? ^Heidi
Thanks! Looking forward to your reply.
Okay! Because these are considered Gift Cards, we cannot price match them. I apologize! ^Heidi

Hey! Let me dig into this for you really fast. ^Heidi
Can I have the email of an actual person please?
As Derek provided - Twitter@BestBuy.com will reach our team. ^Heidi
I need to talk to a person who can help me with a problem above and beyond your policy. You sold me a $1000 stove that is leaking gas.
You are more than welcome to email us so we can get the correct teams involved. ^Heidi
so the best thing would be to go back to the store?
I would say so. Otherwise you can try and contact the manufacturer as well. ^Heidi
the thing is, none of the stores near me have any extra stock of sonic mania according to the website.
They might be able to order one in for you. ^Heidi
it's missing the battery cover underneath the statue.
Uh oh! I would recommend to revisit the store as soon as you can and speak with a manager about this. ^Heidi
@user I did an online order/store pick up yesterday and found my 10% birthday coupon this morning. Is there anyway retroactively redeem?
Hi! I really wish there was a way! You would need to return the order and re purchase it with the coupon. ^Heidi
@user I renewed my Gamers Club Unlocked online, it says it's "ready for download" but my subscription hasn't been renewed...
Hey there, Sorry about any troubles - The activation can take up to one week to fully process. ^Heidi
Yo @user called support, no help. Someone broke into your online system and used my CC on file to try to order. That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted your bank to report it? In the meantime I would recommend to change your online password.^Heidi
Thanks for your help! We will check it out and hopefully find the perfect one

Laptop wasn't same price as when I bought.  Had to "return" and "rebuy" to get MS Office discount.  Laptop $50 higher now
Regretablly, we do not have info on availability. I would be best to keep an eye on our website for any updates. ^Ken
Screw it. I'm going to @user Thanks for your answers, Ken. The only reason I tweeted you is because there's no customer service in stores
For privacy reasons we ask that you delete your order number. Have you spoken with a store manager? ^Ken
For customer satisfaction reasons, I ask that you honor your commitment to delivery & installation, but we can't all get what we want right?
Greetings Matthew, That is not what we want to hear. Could you share with us what happened? ^Ken
Was ready to buy office, wireless mouse and printer ink tonight.  Another $200+.  Store wouldn't honor their word.  Wish could return all
Greetings Matthew, That is not what we want to hear. Could you share with us what happened? ^Ken
Bought tv and install 2 weeks ago $2.5k.  Bought laptop 7 days ago $250.  Was told to bring receipt in for $20 off office.  Was not honored
Oh no, that doesn't seem right. Were you given an explanation for the no show? ^Ken
No. It was scheduled 4 the 15th, switched to 12th, then had no deliv date, then confirm for 15th & still nothing. Order  check
Te sugiero que hables con un representante de la tienda para saber si calificas para una igualación de precios. (2/2) ^Karina
Me podrían pasar el contacto de la tienda de mundo e, por favor!
Please know emails are worked on in the order they are received, and our team will respond as soon as we have an update. ^Derek
Does it really take two weeks?
Greetings Rohan, It is possible that the store sold out of the movie. I apologize for the inconvenience. ^Ken
Any idea when it's going to be sold again. I'd order online but Best Buy charges ridiculously high for shipping?
Greetings Rohan, It is possible that the store sold out of the movie. I apologize for the inconvenience. ^Ken
I'm almost done w/ Best Buy.

I'm very sorry for you, I just need it to upload my videos and edit them
Greetings Rohan, It is possible that the store sold out of the movie. I apologize for the inconvenience. ^Ken
Ridiculous.
Yes, this version should be available in stores August 15th. ^Ken
Went to 2 stores. No steel book, Ken. Alien Covenant.
Please send us an e-mail with your details to Twitter@BestBuy.com. One of our specialist will be in contact. ^Ken
I will do but afterwards will be writing a blog after spending years as a Best Buy customer will never use you again
Oh no, I can imagine the frustration. Have you had a chance to speak with a store manager? ^Ken
Yes but situation still not resolved 
We do not have a date for our 4th instillation of the dishwasher we paid for 
First three defective
Greetings. We are happy to take a look over your order. Please send us a DM with your order number. ^Ken
Thank you and just DM'ed you
Please send us an email with your details to Twitter@BestBuy.com. One of our specialist will be in contact. ^Ken
Done. Thanks Ken.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
I took the afternoon off for this to happen.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
Out of frustration.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
Being an Elite Plus Member doesn't feel all that special. 800 customer service said take it up with the store manager. I hung up on them.
Roku specifically calls out those two as supported services in all their materials.
I appreciate your help! Unfortunately, Roku support has been pretty pathetic, which is why I reached out to you guys. Will try them again.
It's possible the current software does not support these two streaming services. You may need to connect back with Roku for resolution.^Tea
Roku specifically calls out those two as supported services in all their materials.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
He says geek squad can't come out anytime soon. They're totally backed up. He offered me a small credit and now I'm stuck.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
The manager said the guy who sold it to me was seasonal and six months ago when he worked there that's how it worked.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
Long story short I bought a tv told that it would be delivered and set up and the guys came dropped off the tv in the box and left.
I would be upset too and concerned. Has this been leaking the entire time that you are aware of? ^Alison
It has been leaking since it was installed. Best Buy should make an exception on 15 day returns for defective items. Put customers first.
Oh no, I can imagine the disappointment of the backorder on your item. We apologize for the inconvenience. ^Ken
Thanks Ken it was just bad timing

The best I've been told is to wait 24-48 hours and call back to see the deal. Most likely going to cancel my order and purchase elsewhere.
Are your orders in a Pending Cancellation status or the authorizations on your credit card? ^Tea
Pending cancellation
Oh dear! That's quite a lot. Can you please confirm your full name and email address via DM for verification? I'd like to review this. ^JD
Let me know what you find, yet another email duplicate as of 5:44pm ET
I can't say for sure as this is outside policy, but you could speak with a manager at the store about this matter. ^JD
Ok. Thanks!
Greetings Charlie, That isn't what we want to hear. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
Ken, see tweets from yesterday.   You are blaming Netgear & NetGear is blaming you so Im stuck with 6 monthWe are unable to exchange damaged items. You are welcome to take it to your local store to see if they can help. ^Megan

Hi, sorry to read this. Can you send me over the cat number and I'll get your feedback forwarded over. Ryan
they can't be sure, but sometimes you can see by how the package is sealed. Surely you shouldn't resell returned things at the same price?

And will it be at that price on its return to store?
Ah sorry, I didn't realise the product is priced to clear. This means we won't be getting the item back in stock. It..1/2
@user is there an issue with your website at the moment?
Hey Philip, I haven't been made aware of any issues recently. What problem are you having? Megan.
Why do @user advertise sold out items on website? Surely it's not a ploy to make disappointed customers buy dearer items? Flymo Glider 350
Sorry Tess, we still advertise sold out products, as they will be coming back in to stock in the future. Holly
No, I bought it in store a few days ago.
If you return to store with your receipt, the team there will be able to sort this out for you. Mark
@user  glitch in their system and that my only recourse is to have a refund (which takes 5 days). Non-existent customer service!!
Hi Richard, many apologies. Can you send us a private message please? James.
@user odd service. Ask for price check on sale item, told full price. State was in sale. Lady shrugs. No offer to check. Pretty 
Hi Mel, I'm really sorry about that, could you send us a private message? James.
@user trying to place a online order 4 click and collect but no option to continue past the Delivery page.tried on 3 diff browsers
It may be that the items are not available, I would try calling the store to make sure they're available. Apologies, Megan.
Crawley, i've called 5 times now and it just rings and rings! Do you have a number for the kitchen showroom dept?
Apologies we don't, just the main store number and they usually just transfer you over to showrooms. Megan.
No this is not a store issue if you can’t deal with this pls escalate to an authority that can or give me email of your cus/service director
b&qcustomerservices@b-and-q.co.uk. Megan.
Your website states Money-off vouchers every time you shop (Scan in store to qualify) Is that a misrepresentation?
Apologies this wasn't something I was aware of, I would advise contacting the store regarding this. Megan.
Who's going to foot the bill, Valspar? @user @user @user 3/3
Hi Chris, could you send us a private message please? James.
I will pack up the tiles ready for you to arrange collection.
Unfortunately we don't offer collections of goods that were collected in store. You'd need to speak to the store about this.
The house as I was late for work. A courtesy call to say he wasn't able to make it would have been perfect!
I'll feed this back to the Aintree store, apologies for the inconvenience caused by this Nicole. Megan.
I didn't go to store-appointment made to come to house and price up bathroom@9am. I called several times, no one gave me a straight answer
Have you spoken with someone from the store about this now? Megan.
Thanks Mark. All stock has now been sent to another store. Will I be refunded for my fuel cost, as this is due to poor stock handling.
Unfortunately this is not something we can do Andy. James.
@user Signed up with Club Had welcome voucher + 1 after 1st purchase 2 more purchases & no vouchers but getting receipts Is this right
Hi there, that would be correct. You receive a welcome voucher after your first purchase, not after every purchase. Megan.
@user Made a special journey to buy these tiles from Cheltenham store yesterday. Very disappointed to find the bottom tile smashed!pic.twitter.com/mkRG3P0Vzm
Sorry about this Andy, you'll be able to get this replaced in store if you return with your receipt. Mark
@user bought a gate handle yesterday. Product 29413263. EAN 5397007136487. Has anyone from bnq ever tried to open the packaging on product?

I never made an online account. I just signed up for the card and started getting receipts and offers via email. That just stopped.
Hi there, could you send us a private message please? James.
@user just done click and  collect got to store sorry none in stock check stockport they have the product got there guess what none in
Hi Rob, could you send us a private message with more information please? James.

Hi Lauren! I'm really sorry about that, which store are you trying to contact? James.
2/2 @user because your system fails. You were supposed to specifically book in a pick up for today. You really have terrible support
Sorry about this Ben, can you tell us what's happened via the link, please?@user if I order via click and collect to avoid going out of stock but won't be able to collect until next weekend will it still be there?
Hi Amee, the goods will be held for 14 days after the Click & Collect order is placed. James.

Sorry about this Eleanor, can you send us more info via the link, please?Okay thanks! Can you use it straight away in store?
As long as you have the number, absolutely :) James.

Can you help with my Valspar paint problem please? Been waiting a month now. Thanks
Hi Louise, could you send us a private message please? James.
@user Why don't I get a receipt emailed anymore after each purchase? Suddenly just stopped!
Hi Marieke, please log in to your club account online and check that your marketing preferences haven't changed. Mark

@user My mum has signed up to a B&Q card online - how long will it take to come? And is there any way she can use it before it comes?
Hi Hannah, in order to get a physical card, you'll need to pick one up in store! As for using it online... (1/2)
@user hello is is possible for @user to return this lightbulb? It came out of the packet like this. Thanks in advancepic.twitter.com/I9jsgDwQcK
Hi, if they still have their receipt, they may be able to return this yes. It is down to the store manager's discretion however.
I did consider that, but that meant having to deal with them again 
Hi Charlotte, we can look into this for you, just send over a private message.@user bought this Diall wall tile adhesive today at eltham b&q. It this use-by or manufacture date?pic.twitter.com/tn9S9YVjjD
Hi Jo, I believe that's an expiry date, sorry about that! If you take it back the store will exchange it. Leigh
@user @user Why is your online stock checker wasting my time?  It says IN STOCK until the very end then...NO! Item 8718291488682 ?
Sorry for the disappointment! The item is on clearance so it's likely the stock is too low to fulfil your order. Leigh
@user have only had BBQ for a few months and look what's happening?pic.twitter.com/vuWK9Dpx1m
Sorry about this Mark, can you send a private message with a photo of your receipt?@user Hi, could you guys check the status of an online order for me?

Sorry James, that doesn't seem right. Did you buy this in store or order it for delivery? Leigh
Have the used trade coloured mixed in store in the conservatory which is fine and in the lounge brilliant white off the shelf which is  /2
Hi Martyn, can you send a private message so we can discuss this further?. @user @user thanks for advertising products that are not available. 9 out of 9 unavailable  Sorry, not all the products online are available in every store, but if they're not on clearance they should be restocked. Leigh
Look into this? I've put it on my table so what do I do whilst they look into it?
Since you bought this in store, it's down to them to discuss an exchange or refund, if the product is considered faulty. Leigh
@user Pretty irate. Waited in 8 hrs on 2 days for delivery due on 4th. No calls from you, still no goods. On hold 40 mins.Disgusted.
Sorry your delivery hasn't come Melissa. Can you send a private message with your order details?@user bought this yesterday, followedthe instructions and within 24 hours it is chipping already, not good enoughpic.twitter.com/7sOc0OW8te
Sorry about this James! If you take it back to store with your receipt, they'll be able to look into this for you. Leigh
Not what I meant, it's hard to get across. I can go in store then buy online via your staff, but pay in store with vouchers, yes?
Ah I see! Yes, you can order in store for home delivery, and pay with vouchers. Leigh
@user 

Just been denied a refund for a product I bought from B&Q a couple of days ago.
Hi there, we'll respond to your private message now. James.
@user - yes - the surveyor let me down twice. Not good .
Sorry about that, do you need the survey rescheduled or refunded? Leigh
@user hello, would like to raise a complaint after an incident in one of your stores this morning, how can I do this?
Hi Caroline, could you send us a private message please? James.
@user hi, I would like to buy using vouchers that are not usable online. Can I order online in store then pay by vouchers in store 
You can't order online and pay later in person I'm afraid, you would need to make the purchase fully in store. Leigh
@user hello! Ive DM'd you about my yellowish skirting!
Hi there, we've responded to your private message. James.
@user I bought 10 tubs of sika quick drying grout at £18 a throw. It just looks awful and hasn't set 6 weeks later.pic.twitter.com/YXHKFSrO9R
Sorry Angus! Did you buy in store or online? Please send more info via the link.Sorry about that Ellie, my colleagues in store may have meant that it was discontinued in the Grantham store. Holly
Not exactly good when your staff send customers elsewhere & don't know what they can sell, could have ordered it in for us or said go online
Sorry about that Ellie, my colleagues in store may have meant that it was discontinued in the Grantham store. Holly
Well considering they said no it's a discontinued paint at b&q and sent us to Homebase I don't think they meant in store.
Sorry about that Luke, was this purchased online or in store? Holly
Hi Sam, it was ordered through tradepoint
@user why are we told this paint is discontinued yet you sell it online??? Now going to have to order & wait even longer! Not helpfulpic.twitter.com/VA19qmppDQ
Got told by staff in store at Grantham that it's no longer stocked, yet clearly you still sell it...
I'm afraid not, your dad will have to take his ID into store. Mark
Ok I'll get him to pop into the store
Hi if you pop in to store and provide your father details, they will be able to set up a new card for him. Holly
Ahh I see we can't do it online then can we?
Thanks for confirming that. I'll make sure the store are aware of this. Megan.
Thanks, I don't know if it will help as it was in the actual bag rather than on it.
Hi Matthew, I've had a look on our website and this is discontinued so it's unavailable for purchase. Apologies, Megan.
Ok thanks perhaps it should be discontinued from your website also then.
We can only transfer within 15 miles of each store. Apologies, Megan.

Oh no! Apologies, did you buy this in store or online? Megan.
Bought it from your store in in riverside, Nottingham. Got 3 bags, first was fine but then the second I noticed glass shards
Hi there, did you contact us to pass on details to Valspar? It can take up to 3 working days to be contacted by Valspar. Megan.

Thanks, will do.
Hi there, really sorry about this. Can you private message me your full name and address?Have messaged you.
Hi Joseph, that's great to hear! When were you in store? I'll get this fed back. Brad
So I told him my issue, he did his thing and rang me back to confirm they had it and I could collect tomorrow. I felt he went the extra mile
Hi Joseph, that's great to hear! When were you in store? I'll get this fed back. Brad
Hi Brad, I rang the store and off to collect tomorrow. Scott was very helpful to solve why site said stock, but when ordering said wasn't.
Hi there, it shouldn't be any later than 8pm. If you would like us to look into this, please send us a PM. Megan.
Pm sent, thanks megan
Hi Gabrielle, have you had any contact with Valspar since letting us know? Brad

Sorry Elly, have you spoken to your bank about this? Holly
Yes I have to wait for it to return as it's in the middle thanks to B&Q
Hi there Elly, I'm really sorry about that. Did you manage to sort out a refund? James.
Not impressed
Hi there, if you would like to discuss this with us further please send us a private message. Thanks, Megan.
Yes I will do. Thanks
We've not been given a date but the best bet would be to keep an eye on our website. Thanks, Megan.
Ok thanks
Sorry Shaun, but this product is not available to order yet, as it's a new item. Holly
Ok thanks! When will it be available to order?
@user How do i purchase you Form slidding wardrobe doors? Nothing in-store or online?pic.twitter.com/k2b1oUJ09h

It's was on a desktop, but will download the app, cheers
Hey Philip, I haven't been made aware of any issues recently. What problem are you having? Megan.
Cannot look at product descriptions when going through lists of various products. Might be local chrome or IE settings maybe?
Sorry Tess, we still advertise sold out products, as they will be coming back in to stock in the future. Holly
That's strange as the item is priced to clear?
Apologies we don't, just the main store number and they usually just transfer you over to showrooms. Megan.

They said it was out of stock, but no one emailed us or updated the order status. My pregnant wife is really upset as we really needed it.
I really do apologise Ashley. Would you be available to chat about this in the morning over Live Chat so we can resolve this? - Abby
it won't let me DM your account??
My mistake! I'm sorry.. I am now following you. - Abby
Ok thankyou. How do I request this? I went to "contact us" but couldn't see a phone number or email
This is our Customer Services Freephone :) - 0800 092 3355 - Abby
I've got someone that seems THICK !
Please do not ridicule advisors who are there to help. Who did you get through to? - Abby
@user my account is £19 in credit. How do I get a refund?
Hi Nicola, you can request this to be sent to you as a cheque :) - Abby
@user cancelled our baby furniture set with under 4 weeks till our baby's due.. ordered 16th July! We phoned up today to be told!!!
Hi Ashley, that is ridiculous! I am so sorry.. did they give you a reason as to why this has been cancelled? - Abby
@user 1 and 1/2 hours waiting to speak to someone on live chat still no joy , they too busy playing with my credit limit to do chats
Hi Baz, we do currently have availability on the chat here is the link. - Abby
@user struggling to log in tonight, are you having issues, I've tried via the app and URL.
Hi, I've not heard anything regarding these troubles.. very odd. Is it an issue with the app or just the log-in? - Abby
I've tried that no live chat
The option will become available when an advisor is available. - Abby
I'm going to send backwhats arrived & close account a absolute waste of time today trying to sort out & no one seems to know what's going on
I'm sorry to hear this Leila, If there is anything we can do here on Twitter please don't hesitate to let me know. - Abby
Please do. If you can get to the bottom of it, you'll be the only helpful person today! Fingers crossed.
Could you please DM me so I can discuss this further.. I won't be a moment I assure you :) - Abby
I speak to the rude people in South Africa all the time
I do apologise Ceejay, if you pop to our Live Chat we can help there.. - Abby
After having an advice note saying my items had been delivered, having 2 items missing, lots of phones calls. Turns out items weren't sent!
I'm sorry to hear this Layla. Has this now been rectified? - Abby
This is what I ordered? I didn't see an option to tick at check out -but i want pay for it over 12 months Can you correct this for me??pic.twitter.com/0HNqMQcMan
We can look into this of course. If you pop onto our Live Chat we can see if the option is there - Abby
What happened to liverpoo
We have call centres in various locations it is simply down to chance which one you get through to Ceejay. - Abby
I cant get through
I do appreciate it is a little busy at the moment. I assure you our advisors are working hard to get chats :) - Abby
It's a pressure cooker. Please don't tell me you'll get me a courier or to go on a Live Chat...
carrier and find out exactly what seems to be going on at their end.. - Abby
It's a pressure cooker. Please don't tell me you'll get me a courier or to go on a Live Chat...
Hi Georgina, unfortunately however we can't access accounts on Twitter so we would direct you to Live Chat but we do need to contact the...
@user absolutely horrendous service! Spent hours trying to sort out their cock up! What a nightmare!
Hi Leila, I'm sorry to hear this! Is there anything I can do hear to help? - Abby
and why haven't you given me my money back? Why is this taking so long to sort out?
Hi Scott, please PM me so I can discuss this in further detail (limited with characters on tweets) - thank you, Abby
@user I need to change my address on my account but it's a new build and not coming up with postcode. Nowhere to input it directly
Hi Lauren, may I ask how long you've had your account for? - Abby
Yes she helped me on chat, advised i could get a like 4 like and now callcentre are saying i have to wait out for the part to come. Confused
Amy is currently unavailable at the moment. However we do have other fab team members on chat at the moment :) - Abby
Ok - ill try that.
Here is our link if you are happy to wait :) - Abby
You can tell. It's obviously not a dedicated service.
We appreciate that feedback. However on Social Live Chat we have a few less barriers when it comes to process.. but it is busy at the moment
If there aren't any managers no wonder the agents think they can treat customers badly
There are managers however they aren't always available for escalations as we have a specialist team who would do this. - Abby
Really? Who is it with? Via the complaints area on your website.
Yes, we at Social Media have our own Live Chat and the one on the website is based elsewhere, so we operate a little differently :) - Abby
The live chat is useless. Why dont you have dedicated customer service? Ive emailed in, you claim 24 hour response but that was 3 days ago
This Live Chat is a different one to the one on the website. How did you submit this email? Through the form or the app? - Abby
@user still no call from a manager.  I have a major complaint
Hi Ceejay, may I ask what this is regarding? - Abby
@user I ordered something over £300 I thought I could pay it within 12 months so why isn't it asking me pay a part of it now? xx
Hi Kelly, did the option for Buy Now Pay Later come up at all ? - Abby
I am once again at a stumbling block, could amy get in touch please. I have had enough of this  Call centre are useless and wont replace
Hi Steph, I'm so sorry to hear! you're looking to get a hold of Amy are you? - Abby
No, a price match for a sofa thats price has dropped within the two week window.
Hi Pete, ok. Our live chat is a little busy at the moment. Would you prefer to wait or email in? - Abby
Again, useless link.pic.twitter.com/UPV3JVbc0h
I do apologise you can't instantly be put through to an advisor. We are working to get through to those waiting as fast as we can. - Abby
It's really busy but I'll keep trying for sure. Been hung up on over the phone
It does get busier towards the evenings I am afraid :( Thank you for your understanding we look forward to hearing from you - Abby
@user well done to the team at Very, brand new washing machine arrives so wet it's damaged!!!pic.twitter.com/gEu6Uus4D7
Hi Paul, I am sorry to hear this! Please head to our Live Chat so we can look into this further for you. - Abby
sorted thank you,quick question, it said that if already despatched that you can tell the delivery driver to take it back, is this true
We can request this, but it may be too late as it could be out for delivery. But you can also refuse at the door and it'd be returned - Abby
Nope, had no idea it'd been cancelled until i tracked the package and got that text.
This sometimes happens if the item is found to have been damaged in its transit. We can look into this though. Abby
@user 5 days, no refund. No sense from your customer service and no answer on here.  nah, Hi Pete, I'm sorry to hear this! May I ask if this is in regards to a return? - Abby
Seriously, I'm at my wits' end. 3 times they've said a courier will come & collect. 3 times they haven't! Grrr.....
Hi Georgina, I'm sorry to hear this! May I ask what the item is please?: - Abby
@user please help, it says I've cancelled my order but I haven't???
Hi Mullie, sorry to hear this. We can look into this for you no worries please follow this link to live chat - Abby
I definitely didn't return them, any advice???pic.twitter.com/KHFT9I3Ii8
Had they not even been delivered to yourself? - Abby
Yeah it says there at Wigan we live Tyne na wear I payed for delivery for yesterday I needed them yesterday I don't want them now
We can look into cancelling this for you that's fine :) please follow our Live Chat link - Abby

I am sorry to hear of the service you have experienced. How have you contacted out Web Chat Team, via the website? Thanks Rach
I have already contacted very and been told yodel will deliver on Saturday now, 1 week later due to yet another yodel delay!!,
I just think very should use an alternative delivery service, as yodel clearly is not up to the job, just look at their customer feedback
@user I'm sorry you've had problems with your deliveries. Have a chat with us here and we'll sort it. Gem H
I have already contacted very and been told yodel will deliver on Saturday now, 1 week later due to yet another yodel delay!!,

@user hiya could you direct me to the right option to return my Fitbit. Recently had it replaced and this one isn't picking up
A lot of my exercises and that's kind of the reason i needed it. I don't feel the Fitbit is accurate and value for money.
Have a look online and if you do have any issues get back in touch.  Thanks Simon
'Have a look online' .... where?
I am sorry for that.  What does it tell you when you are trying to log in online? Thanks Simon
Wrong password so I click the link to resend and it never seems to email me the link I've tried 0ver 100 times ?
It may be in your users manual.  Thanks Simon
I don't think I have that anymore
I am sorry for that. Have you tried calling the manufacturer to see if they send a replacement part to you.  Thanks Simon
No I haven't even got a clue where to get a number from
I am sorry for that.  Please log in online and you can arrange a return for them as item unsuitable.  Thanks Simon
Thanks, they are a pair of adidas trainers, the sole has came away and I've only worn 2-3 times a week. Not really acceptable

Cheers
Sorry James, no answer yet I'm afraid but we'll be in touch once we do. Terry.

It was a package with the iPad (it’s ok)
They are awful - one person wouldn't read the notes and couldn't do a subtraction. The other was just too busy and disinterested to reply.
It wasn't her earlier and now its saying you cant connect.   This link is the Live chat not email there for we can talk and access your account there and then - - Shannon
Why dont you have uk based customer service? Why do your complaints hide behind a team that doesn't reply?  Did that on Saturday. Despite claiming a 24 hour response time I am still waiting  They are awful - one person wouldn't read the notes and couldn't do a subtraction. The other was just too busy and disinterested to reply.
Hi Pete i'm so sorry about this please click here for one of our agents to look in to this for you - Shannon
Did that on Saturday. Despite claiming a 24 hour response time I am still waiting  Done.  Are you planning on replying to me there or are you just moving complaints away from your public time line?

That is a very good point, it is possible that they aren't on our restock system yet! @user is it possible to check store stock for a sale item? The size I ordered is a bit too small but no size up available online!
Hi Kirsty! I can certainly have a look! Please DM us with your postcode and the product number Just bought the same jeans from @user as I did not two weeks ago and they don't fit, sort out your sizes sick of this now
Please can you DM me with your email and the jeans you have tried so we are able to pass the feedback across for you.
I appreciate that, but when your sized items go to an 18, I'm pretty sure a L wouldn't cover that. Those items also aren't avail. in curve.
Hi Sam! I completely understand your frustration and I will be sure to pass your comments onto the Design Team! Ok, so not everything. But the first two items I opened were. It's infuriating.
Hi Sam, 
With some of our items these are flexible with their sizes, they cover more sizes such as S=8-10.

Hi Katie, I am really sorry it doesn't look like we are getting those back  Really?! The tag says new arrivals though 
Hi Sam, 
With some of our items these are flexible with their sizes, they cover more sizes such as S=8-10.
I appreciate that, but when your sized items go to an 18, I'm pretty sure a L wouldn't cover that. Those items also aren't avail. in curve.
Hi! All looks Ok our end :) Thanks, Is there any sort of tracking number for UK mail that I can get my hands on?
Hi Karen, we are not able to follow people but once you have followed us it will allow us to reply to DMs :)

Shit I'm only concerned about the marvel tv shows lol. Fuck the movies
Marvel TV shows are not impacted by the recent Disney news!
I really hope @user moving to @user doesn't mean the end of  or I'll cry for days 
this deal doesn't impact existing ABC/Shonda shows at all. It just means future, as-yet-unknown Shonda shows will be Netflix originals!
This means Grey's Anatomy is staying in Netflix forever? YAS!
well technically this deal only impacts *future* Shonda shows. But yes Grey's needs to go on for at least 100 more years
Come on now how am I supposed to watch @user 
This is crazy no warning 
Ok Shonda Rihmes pic.twitter.com/RX5fIVKT5U
don't worry, Scandal/Grey's/HTGAWM aren't going anywhere. this deal applies to future Shondaland shows!
Would Shonda Rhimes moving to Netflix mean that the shows on ABC are ENDING?! Please say no!
nope! all the ABC favorites will keep thriving on ABC (and some of them stream on Netflix as well). this deal is about FUTURE Shondaland 
WOW! GO Shonda!! I'm actually scared, idk if I could survive binging Shondalandnot gonna lie, binge watching Scandal is a physically demanding experience
You guys should sell that as a premium add-on tier
would customers also be interested in a keepsake wine glass the size of Kerry Washington's head? asking for a friend
Netflix has signed a multiyear deal with Shonda Rhimes - poaching her from ABC. Story on @user coming soon
in other news, Netflix subscriptions will now come with a free month's supply of red wine.
Shonda Rhimes 3D traumedy rom-com musical version of the Starting Over House.
just going to screenshot this for later
So @user are we not going to get Luke Cage, Daredevil, Iron Fist or Jessica Jones anymore?
The Defenders are still on the way. Our Marvel series aren't affected by this news at all.
This move by Disney better not affect my  Netflix shows.  This news has no impact on our Marvel series.
@user how is this  news gonna affect your marvel tv shows--HOW?!?!?!
Not at all, this news does not impact our Marvel series.
Disney is ending @user deal and launching its own streaming service pic.twitter.com/84nN8ldtm0
This won't impact our Marvel series.
Just hearing this. They aren't pulling the @user + @user stuff are they?
Nope, the news you're seeing today does not impact our Marvel series.

This is an absolute disgrace
Apologies for the late reply, were you able to speak to the manager of the store? Joe
Hi, she asked to speak to the store manager but they'd only let her speak to a supervisor, I don't know where the store manager was or why

May I ask what time you visited the store and did you get the colleagues name? Jay
Hi. It was between 6 and 8pm I would say. Sorry didn't get his name. Was a on the halal meat counter if that helps
No. I am fed up of you trying to fob me off and pretend nothing happened. We will carry this on where everyone can see how badly you work.
Even had a member of staff in the Weston super Mare store pretending to be the store manager to try to fob me off.
Sorry about this! Drop us a DM with your order number, name and address. Beth
I've dm you but not heard back been nearly 2hours now
This really is beyond idiotic. Refusing to deal with a serious complaint about an assault by member of your staff in the middle of the store
8 weeks of lies after being assaulted by a member of your staff and you try to fob me off with a £25 voucher. It's an insult.
I am sorry we have let you down on this occasion and for any disappointment caused. Beth
You've let yaselfves down really!!!!

@user Apologies for the inconvenience Kerry. Could you confirm the time of the incident so we can log this with the store? Thanks, Jim

@user @user 1hour 18mins,£70 parking fine for no validation after spending in the Wolverhampton store is an absolute joke....1/2
2/2 with how much we spend in store & on fuel per week, is there anything you can do @user ??
Hi - We are proud to consistently offer some of the lowest prices in the market for our feminine care products. Cheers, Jim
But, is it fair to charge VAT for female sanitary products? I'm not sure gender discrimination is fair  You can set a further example
Hi, I'm really sorry about this. Were you able to speak with one of my colleagues in store? Thanks, Beth
no beacuse last time i asked to talk with a manager i was ignored
I'm sorry to see this! I will raise this with the store manager. Apologies for any inconvenience caused. Aisling
Thank you very much.
@user hi, just wondering how items can be on sale in two asdas but not another!
Just trailed round 3 asdas, sold out in the first two and full price in the third!

Disgusting behaviour. @user another pcn charge at asda wolves 2hrs free parking no validation £70 for 1hour 16 mins disgrace
What was your outcome? I've just had exactly the same.
Are you joking? This incident was 24 hours ago. After taking photo's and tweeting Asda I immediately threw the packaging in the bin.
Liam one must always hord rubbish, it's not within one's nature to dispose of it

I'm fine, rather I was just finding it utterly ridiculous that someone could complain of an item not being replaced but having more variety.
I fail to see how complaining about "pandering" to people with different tastes and/or allergies is a joke, but fine if you say so.

Our whips are so good, Jack ;)
During my pre plant based eating days, I loved your walnut whips!

Any chance of a dairy free version..... 
I fail to see how complaining about "pandering" to people with different tastes and/or allergies is a joke, but fine if you say so.
If you failed to see the tongue in cheek you may need to locate your sarcasm gene. As a person with life threatening allergies, I got it.
Will have to try these, love salted caramel.
They're close to perfection but the walnut ones still edge it for me. Have to say all by @user and no I'm not being paid by them
Dear @user I hope you will be retaining the Walnut on your Walnut whips 
always defending the walnuts, @user - and rightly so!
It was a joke. I genuinely couldn't care less.

"Oh no they're keeping what I like but adding extra types?!  I must complain!"
It was a joke. I genuinely couldn't care less.
Pander?  Bitch, nut allergies are a thing, how the feck is it pandering that they want to widen their potential customers?
"Oh no they're keeping what I like but adding extra types?!  I must complain!"
I resent the new ones though. Walnut whips for people who don't like walnuts. We shouldn't pander to them. Where will it end?
Pander?  Bitch, nut allergies are a thing, how the feck is it pandering that they want to widen their potential customers?
THEY DO! And they're so good 
I need to get some of those! Perhaps I'll treat myself this Friday

Was emailed to say wifi was up and running today. Have plugged router into every phone port and nothing. Customer service appalling 
Hi Kara, lovely to hear from you. Are there any models in particular you are interested in? I can check which shops have them - J
Oooo there are LOADS, Panasonic lumix, Sony cyber-shot, canon powershot. Just wondered which shop had the largest selection? Thanks

Aw, OK! Thanks for letting us know! We'll get this looked into. Have a lovely night. :) - Martin
You too martin thanks for getting back to me quickly as well
I totally appreciate why you're disappointed! We'll make sure this is shared with our team. Sorry about this again, Daniel. - M
Disappointed isn't really the word. I wanted an Ipad today and went to get one. Your staff stopped that from happening.
Sorry to read this John. Did the other partner speak to you about your concerns? - Jenna
No. She just said 'it's one of those days for her' really was poor!
@user You deliver a cracked vase, what am I supposed to do? Really disappointing. Is a gift and need a replacement ASAP. pic.twitter.com/Lslfg6Ka1B
Really sorry to hear that! We'll make sure your feedback is shared with our Branch management team! - Martin
Not the same anymore. That would never have happened five years ago.
Ah, thanks for letting us know Paul! Will you return to branch to have the difference returned to you? - Martin
75p it ok martin cost me more in petrol and finding a parking space
Oh dear. That's not welcoming! Which branch was this in? - Martin
Trafford centre. Drove for 30 minutes to get anniversary present. Ended up leaving it there. Not welcome understatement.
Thanks for letting us know, Laura. We'll share this with our team to have them look into this! - Martin
Do I get a 4 year warranty on my new camera as a reward? 
We now expect Apple Pay to be available for the partnership card in late 2016 or early 2017 ~ Adrienne.
This is becoming farcical - why can't @user just be honest and say we're not doing it.
And this one too, says "added care to ensure your peace of mind lasts even longer"It all reads like Added Care adds 2yrs to JL guarantee + accidental = 4yrs.
Hi Sarah. Sorry to hear this! :( Can you confirm it's the JL100 model? - Martin
Yup that's it. Bought as a wedding present ten years ago!
Can you link us to the page where you see this, Laura? - Martin
And this one too, says "added care to ensure your peace of mind lasts even longer"Can you link us to the page where you see this, Laura? - Martin
Googled John Lewis guarantee, this was too resultOh we don't like any customer to feel disappointed! Can you tell me a little more here of the issues. Happy to assist - A.
Buying gift, went to instore wrapping. 'it won't fit in box wouldn't look professional, we have standards to keep' was how I was greeted.
Hey Laura! :) No. Added care runs alongside your product warranty, it doesn't extend it! - Martin
Then why does the JL website say "once the guarantee has expired" bit confusing?
Apologies! Just seen your 2nd tweet. Our Partners will be more than happy to help you with this! - Martin
Thank you for your response.
Apologies! Just seen your 2nd tweet. Our Partners will be more than happy to help you with this! - Martin
I called Customer Service to make sure we were not accused of wearing the trainers.
Ah, OK! That's not good :( Let us know which branch this was in Daniel and we'll share your feedback! - Martin
Norwich. I even said I wanted to buy today. Asked to compare 10.5 & 9.7 side by side. Said can't do it and walked off then no service.
Really sorry to hear this happened, Daniel. Did you speak to our management team in branch at the time!? - Martin
No. One walked off whilst talking.I was then ignored by the other 2 staff. I said excuse me please to one 3 times and he walked off.
Hey Helena! Thanks for tweeting. Pop us along an email to: tell.us.more@johnlewis.co.uk & we'll share your feedback! - Martin
Will do thanks.
Oh that's nice! You can use the balance checker at: Happy spending! - Alan.
Thanks, if I scratch the pin off to check the balance can I still use them in store?
The team have called in that timeframe, I'll ask them to make a further attempt to reach you - Alan.
Thank you.
Sorry you left the shop feeling disappointed Michelle. Do you wish to speak with anyone from the team regarding the item? - A
Not presently thank you, my husband is now going to order online with JLstore, in the comfort of our home, without being looked down at. Thx
Hi Dani, I can see the team have been trying to reach you to discuss an alternative resolution. Have you received voicemails?
None at all. Was told I'd get a call last Wednesday and I've heard nothing.
How annoying, sorry to hear please call our myjohnlewis team on 0345 610 0312 who will be happy to discuss further ~ Sharon
Oh, I have, don't you worry about that...! @userHi there, can  you give me further details of what you're needing assistance with? - Alan
Bought a Hugo boss wallet 8 or 9 months ago as a gift .. It's already falling apart, awful quality. Bought from JL Blue water.pic.twitter.com/EMECqOxdee
Appreciate your disappointment Raychal. Have you received any further updates on your order being available? - Alan
No more updates it's very expensive and exciting order so it's very disappointing
You're welcome Bethany :)
Got my stamp but no treats left thanks for trying though! They sent me to the Loccitane shop but they couldn't help.
Sorry you've not had a resolution Janette. Where is your message from? I can't see any history of conversation from here - J

get a new prescription "just in case". Of what? A need to wear glasses for cosmetic reasons? 

Or another case of Boots milking the NHS?
Hard to say for sure without performing the test. 20/20 is average vision. New prescription may make vision clearer - or more comfortable
Please dm us your telephone number, post code & email and will see what we can find on your account. Many thanks.

Bad, bad pun.
Not just tampons, every sanitary 'ladies' product. Which according to the tax man and is a 'luxury item' needs to be banned is unfair.
Imagine thinking periods are a luxury?  even being near a lass whilst there on is painful sometimes, can't imagine having to go through it
It's a bloody disgrace ! They have a tampon tax
It certainly is, but sanitary products are apparently luxury items. Needs to be banned. But good on Tesco and others for paying it for us.
mind blown
Scone blown
@user I am blown away by this

It's utter fucking lunacy that there's a tax on tampons like

This is ‘speculative inventory”, when a seller creates a post BEFORE tickets are sold by Ticketmaster or other primary sellers. ^ML
its disappointing, to say the least.

Hey @user your site sent a transaction through that I tried to cancel.  Didn't send the confirmation til I had rebought.
I called customer support and they said there is nothing they can do about it.  I can't believe I could be charged $160 for a tech error
Hello! Payment for reselling tickets usually takes 7-10 days to process and show up in your account. ^JD
Thanks for the quick response.
Hi! For which event, date, and location are you inquiring? MW
All of them. You never post ticket prices before they go on sale anymore. Kinda important information that customers should know.

This is very strange. Are you able to try a different device? Thanks, Stacey
Managed to fix by removing it from my basket and re-adding it. More effort than it should have been though!
We were confused as you said store-finder.Do you mean stock-finder?Please tell me the article number so we can check for you and the store?
601.113.40 at Glasgow.
Not sure why this has happened Phil. I have just tried this myself with no issues. Can you try refreshing or a different browser? Thanks, SG
Just tried both, neither worked...
No. I was just told to wait. My item is to be collected from Stratford Westfield collection centre.
I've submitted a cancellation yesterday but as it may be more than 14 days since estimated delivery I'm not sure I'm getting a full refund?
Hi, have you spoken to Parcel Force about this? - Tasha
No. I was just told to wait. My item is to be collected from Stratford Westfield collection centre.
This is not great to hear but thank you for the feedback, we will pass it on! Thanks, Stacey
Now being told 1 item not available online when elsewhere on website it says that it is. You will be lucky to sell me anything at this rate.pic.twitter.com/n81YLz3MjB

Thanks for letting us know. When placing the order, the slot isn't guaranteed. I will feed this on though in case there was an error - KL
When delivery is so expensive at £35, I'm annoyed at being messed about. Please can you see if you can arrange a refund for delivery costs?
Thanks for letting us know. When placing the order, the slot isn't guaranteed. I will feed this on though in case there was an error - KL
That's all she said "it's an error". I've now booked a £45 train ticket home for the morning thinking that was the delivery time?!
Waiting for my basket to unlock following a timeout during checkout. Previous order took 3 attempts to actually get delivered.
Your processes could be slicker, would be my feedback. I seem to spend a lot of time on webchat & the phone with you recently.
Oh no! Is there anything we can help with? - Tasha

Hi, can you please DM us further details so we can look into this for you? -Thanks I have sent a msg
It depends on which fronts you've got as it may be that you have the wrong attachments - Katie-Lou
I think there is a fundamental design flaw with Behjälplig, the plastic clips aren't strong enough to support doors.
It depends on which fronts you've got as it may be that you have the wrong attachments - Katie-Lou
This was the attachment recommended by your kitchen designers?
Do you have an IKEA dishwasher? If so which one? - Katie-Lou
No i have a Bosch - I don't think you need a Behjälplig adapter for an IKEA dishwasher?

nope, no re-book or refund. It's currently missing as the covers for the cushions have been delivered but nothing else
Its not always based on floors, it can be down to other factors as well, have you re-booked or arranged a refund? - Katie-lou
Saw an Ikea ad & pretty sure voiceover guy pronounced 'Ikea' incorrectly. He said it Ikea but I think it should be Ikea. Which is correct?
Hi Suzanne, which store please? - Tasha
Hi Tasha lakeside Thurrock please

Can't believe it,I've been more than once for it. So begrudge paying delivery after being instore just for it. Label just says out of stock.
How can it be in store but then not available there? At all ever? So annoyed.
Hi, can I ask if you've spoken to someone in store about this at all? - Tasha
No one evident to speak to.
Hi! Thanks for bringing this to our attention! It would be super cool to have a table for D&D and dining! Maybe someday!
Swedish maybe = English definitely; I read that in a coffee table book. And the coffee table is from IKEA, so there's that.

Hi, you can order that mirror to be delivered to you but can't pickup in store. You can find it here: - Tasha
So it'll never be in stock in store? I've been all the way from Blackpool for it :(

Your online reps just say "oops, sorry." But this is BS. Your website NOW prices my flight even LESS than what I was supposed to pay.
And, allows offerings in out of the way locations, where there are no traditional hotels. Realize that's not response to issues in Banff...

you always sending me ' urgent deal now ' but there is NEVER ACTUALLY A DEAL ! @user strange way to attract biz
Their point system is a joke too.
I'm genuinely curious about this, because I don't know about it. What kinds of marketing?
Mostly bait and switch online advertising. ie. quoting a lower prices associated to property images than they really are.
And moreover, I've had a great experience with Air bnb. Found accommodations I wouldn't otherwise have found. Not just hotel rooms.

OTA's are also responsible for a 30% cancellation rate. Again a cause for inflated prices.

That's a fair point. But in my experience, the 3rd party price is usually the same or lower than direct booking. But, don't use that much.
OTA's employ gorilla marketing tactics.

Those OTA's ie. @user @user can be responsible for as much as 70% of bookings & command 15 - 25% commission. Inflating price.
Blame @user & @user for inflated hotel prices. Not the hoteliers. They are price drivers.

That's fine. When will i receive a refund as the money is shown to  have left my account?

The interest is calculated on the payment free period and the repayment period. This will be taken off your credit limit. You can avoid(1/2)
So if I get BNPL on that item I'll only be charged right now for the actual amount it's for sale for? Not the interest yet?
Hi, online you chose to spread the cost over 104 or 156 weeks, depending on what you pick, the interest will differ. Thanks, Amy.
So if I do BNPL it won't take the interest off my credit?
Hi Josie, You will see the interest when you're going through the checkout. You need to select the terms. Thanks, Amy.
When I select BNPL it doesn't say
Hi Louise, Sorry you feel this way. You can chat with one of our team using the below link- - Thanks, Amy.
Yeah got an even worse response on that
Hi Josie, If BNPL is available for you, the option will appear on orders of £50 or more. Thanks, Amy.
I know I'm eligible but I mean how much do you need credit as it takes the interest off your credit until paid doesn't it?
Hi Louise, I'm sorry but we cannot call from here as we are a social media department - Thanks Shannon

Unable or unwilling? Littlewoods makes money hand over fist. More than enough to not exploit the labour of Yodel's zero hours workforce.
Yodel is indisputably the worst delivery service in the country. Their drivers are overworked and underpaid. Look at the complaints.

Yeah, the $8 voucher. Doesn't quite make up for what will most likely end up being a 5 hour delay

Had a problem with my @user reservation and they fixed it right away and upgraded my seat. @user should take notes. We apologize for the delay yesterday, Garrett. If need help with anything else, then please let us know via DM.
@user wow super "new" aircraft... no lavs, no water... even @user has lavs... We're going to get this over to the right team for a quick fix. For documentation purposes, did you let the crew know?
I messaged you in DM, waiting for response.
We're taking a look at it now. Give us a moment and we'll send you a response there.
That doesn’t help @user my meeting is at 12:30 at JFK
There's a 9:50a flight from MCO that arrives to JFK at 12:30p. You can ask our airport team about getting on this one instead.
@user here to help with rebooking. DM your record locator.
@user I will never fly you again.. complete and utter bull shit ..would love to hear an explanation bc I can't get one at the airport
You sound upset, what's going on?
Beautiful day for a flight with @user like a greAAt day to us too. We're flying those colors proud at 37,000 ft up.
"Don't recline the chair till the plane takes off" what kinda nonsense is this @user takeoff and landing, your chair must be upright. This is for your safety, which is our top priority.
@user what is the best email to use to file a complaint? Thank you!
You would just DM us here. Feel free to treat that format as an email, as there is no character limit.
@user do your 737s have seat back IFE screens ? Thanks
Good news! They do. You can always check to see what each plane offers here,Today I am mostly leaving Chicago on @user looks like we're ready to go! Enjoy your flight.
@user i want some kind of refund from business to main naw i aint buying that
If we can help, then please DM your record locator and details.
Not to mention my other out of pocket expenses. Worst customer service ever! @user try to take of our customers as quickly as we can. Our apologies that this is taking longer than expected.
@user your gate agent just pulled me out of boarding and yelled at me and said that "we were not equal". What on earth?
This concerns us, please meet us in DMs so we can follow up.
@user 2 first class tickets and they couldn't wait two minutes? Last flight, plane was going to sit in SAN overnight. frustrating.
We know it's frustrating to miss a flight. Let us know if you'd like some help with rebooking.
Sent you the baggage tag numbers. But how do you think we can manage staying in Amazon without our meds,jackets and another essentials?
The bag is expected to be on flight AA2529 connecting to AA972 to LIM.
Thank you @user for allowing active-duty military w/ ID to board early. You bet! We love our military and appreciate everything you do for us.
@user plane was late (late plane daily in DBQ bc of AA over scheduling), then 2 switched planes, missed connection by 2 minutes.
Can you please meet us in DMs, and confirm your record locator?
Second time in a few weeks that @user cancels the 8:30am DCA-BOS flight at last second. Not good. We don't like to cancel flights, Guy. We're so sorry for the changes to your plans. Do you need help with rebooking?
@user is trash. Literally so done with them. 
We strive to always be the best! Let us know what happened so we can try to turn this around.
@user how am I to start my vacation ? Everything I need to enter the Amazon are in those baggages. All I get is $50 for ur screw up ?
Please DM your record locator, we'll take a look for you.
For fuck's sake, I'm never flying @user again
You seem frustrated. What's going on today?
Once again. I hate to fly with @user is the worst service ever.Your staff is rude since the moment you book till you gett off the 
Our team is expected to provide excellent service from start to finish. We're very sorry for any rudeness you experienced.
@user ... Worst travel experience ever ...
We don't like hearing this. How can we help?
You have really bad service @user always want to provide you with great service! Is there anything we can do to help?
Hey @user flight delayed 2+ hours. Going to miss my connection and my meeting in NYC. And then flight home. Refund for those flights?
We see you've been rebooked on the 11:35a into EWR. Please let us know once you reach your destination.
@user I still do not have my luggage! This is ridiculous! Your text and tracker are a waste of time.
What's your bag file number, we'll take a look.
We're very sad to see you go, we hope you'll give us another chance in the future. You'll always be apart of our fAAmily.
We're committed to making sure our customers have the best experience we can offer. The changes are structured around this thought process.
The flight was scheduled at 6.40 not 7.15!!!
Our apologies for the late start. We appreciate your patience.
We've tried for days! We need the contact info of a manager or someone who can actually help.
Have your sister reach out to us here and we'll check on this.
Can I call from UK?
One of our Reservation offices can help, here's a list of the offices that can help,Thanks @user for charging me extra to book a "window seat" with no window. Pff   We're sorry that you don't have the view you expected. But you do have the extra leg room so you can be comfy.
Hi @user why the flight 932 is late everyday? Almost as flights 947 and 939. Everyday!!!
The flight has pulled out from the gate, as soon as we get the OK, we'll have wheels up.
Please send us your 6-letter record locator or the ticket number next to the charge on your credit card so that we can take a look for you.

We appreciate your loyalty. We're always looking for ways to improve this, and we're committed to providing a great on time experience.
Thanks. Sometimes my loyalty is forced. The delays lately have been too long/numerous. Wish someone would compensate me for them
Take heart. In my experience United isn't any better.
I have been heavily weighing Delta who will match my status....
Because no @user flight can just leave the fucking gate without issue.   Take heart. In my experience United isn't any better.

But still, there's an error in pricing. In your website the price is 73.60 and in SNCB's page it's 40.80 for 4 people...
We can’t always offer the base price on SNCB's site and we don’t have access to some promo fares. See our FAQ page:I was looking for the 10.28h one, which in the web doesn't exist.... At the official site I get one to 10.08h that doesn't appear on the app
I also don't see a departure at 10:28, and we can't offer the 10:08 because it includes that local bus for which we can't sell tickets.
we can't offer a few of those journeys (e.g. 6:01 or 8:01 departures), because they include a local bus that we cannot sell tickets for. 1/2

The bit at Liverpool Street just before where you put your ticket through the gates to get to the platforms! :)
Thank you, this would be @user bad  @user then !
Was this member of staff on the platform or at the ticket office please?
Actually is there anyway to do this route without changing in New Malden nessecarily as I don't need to for this journey
You can plan your journey via the following link to see all services available to you.Having worst 24 hours of my life, & a @user employee at Liverpool Street's inability to have manners has sent me over the edge
Sorry to hear this Ellie, we don't have any staff members at stations I'm afraid.
Sure. Are there touch points inside the station/on platforms anywhere or just at the main entrance?
These are usually located at the main entrance.
@user 3 times in the last two weeks the 8:21 from Levenshulme has stopped at Oxford Rd for 20+ mins for no reason. Infuriating.
I'm so sorry about this, @user maybe able to advise why these were delayed.
@user Hi, I commute from Colchester into London Liverpool Street - how long will the disruption last?   Hi there, the disruption is expected until the end of service.
Thanks you very muvh
You're welcome.
How? So I have to continue trying to find a member of staff every time I need to get through barriers? Not v convenient!
If you visit the ticket office, they maybe able to activate the card again or swap it for you.

Hi there, the train is scheduled to arrive at Leicester at 11:26.
Can I pay the excess? I didn't realise Oxford parkway was before Oxford :/
Yes this is no problem at all, you can either purchase before hand or on the train.
Last time i used the service it was delayed by more than an hour, therefore i recieved vouchers, but in the end have made no saving!!!
I'm sorry to hear this, you would need to contact the train operator you travelled with regarding this and they would offer compensation.
Many thanks.
You're welcome.
Okay great, thank you
You're welcome.
Does anyone know if trains are running normally yet?    Hi there, delays of up to 10 minutes can be expected until 12:00 on this route.

Hi there, the ability to use your ticket today is only valid on South West Trains services. Sorry for any inconvenience.
Yes - was told my phone may cause this (?) but when I said my phone & ticket are never together, they said they didn't know. V frustrating!
I'm so sorry about this, it is possible that the card has de-activated at some point causing it to stop working.
That is why I need to change via Woking and havantpic.twitter.com/57lRvBAQnH
Hi there, I will look into this for you and get back to you.

Hi, Its a complementary service and may not be available for all flights. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. ^Brenda

Hi Olivia, You can email us your query and booking reference to cares@thomson.co.uk ^Brenda
U won't talk 2 me as I'm not lead passenger. My mum is very ill & I am emailing on her behalf! Disgusting customer service!
Hi, We'll require an email from the lead passenger giving authorisation for us to discuss the booking with you. ^B
hardly a complimentary service if I had to pay for the privilege! If I pay to select seat now will I still get to select before check in?
Hi Rachael, Online check-in is complementary but select your seats its optional. ^Brenda
My order confirmation advises I can check in 7 days before. I have been trying since then, without success. If complementary why can't I?
Hi, If the complementary online check-in isn't available you'll be able to complete the check-in at the airport. ^BC

Hi Rebecca, Are you booking a package holiday with us ? ^Oli
@user can u confirm your policy on a 4 year old and 8 year old sitting alone on a plane is?? All 4 of us have been split up.
Hi, Children under 12 years will be sat by an adult on the booking. ^Katie
I tried to book with tele no you gave. Holiday not available. Not acceptable that Thomson advertise holidays that are not available.
Hi, This is showing available through our system. We're waiting a response from our web errors team currently. ^Terry
Any update?
Hi Matthew, Can I ask what update you're waiting on please ? ^Oli
@user sent a flight delay claim over 2 months ago and no response after the specified '56' days, am i ever going to get a reply?

@user FlightsDelays UK 01513758765 just advised me that you sold them my personal data including phone number.
Hi Rebecca, This is concerning to read, did you speak to this company over the phone ? ^Oli
HI Johnny, We are currently experiencing high call volumes, is there anything I can help with? ^Lucy
Just tried to again but apparently the offices are closed even though the automated message says it shuts at 5:30! Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
It's a standard response mate I've seen it all over their timeline. I'm so worried about my 2 year old but hubby refuses to pay nearly £100!
Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
And then on here.... aim to! What does that even mean.
I see you eventually got your reply not that it's much use as they don't give a straight answer. It's the same reply to everybody 
Ridiculous isn't it! Been told on the phone 101% we'll be next to each other, told in the shop make sure I'm there 3hrs b4 to have a chance
Hi Ron, What is it we can help you with ? ^Oli
@user @user of your directors call me , this is a complete joke
So you'd expect a 4 year old to sit next to another family...... impressive customer service!!
I see you eventually got your reply not that it's much use as they don't give a straight answer. It's the same reply to everybody 
That phone line has been busy for the past week! You have changed/downgraded our hotel accommodation and didn’t even tell us!
And changed our flights to a different day and charged us more for the extra leg room seats!
HI Johnny, We are currently experiencing high call volumes, is there anything I can help with? ^Lucy
That phone line has been busy for the past week! You have changed/downgraded our hotel accommodation and didn’t even tell us!
You even sent me an email last night at 19.02 saying "7 days to go, time to check in online" WHY ? So is check in full or not working ?
I can't check in with Thomson either  flying tomz!
Hi Rebecca, If you're travelling on a Thomson Airways flight one bag cannot exceed 23kgs ^Jodie
Thanks for your reply. Do you know if I can use my Visa card for hotel towel deposits and also the tourist tax?
Hi, This would be down to availability. ^Oli
So you'd expect a 4 year old to sit next to another family...... impressive customer service!!
Hi Emma, If you were to cancel you're booking it would be under our normal Terms And Conditions. ^Oli
Surely by selling holidays to hotels you know to be unsafe you are breaching your T&Cs yourself?
Hi Claire, As this is a complimentary service this can close at anytime. You will need to check in at the airport ^C
So I should have waited up until 00.01to be in with a chance of checking in online & what I was told about there being an issue was rubbish
Hi Steph, Do you currently have a booking with us ? ^Oli
No just looking at the moment but will have a infant travelling
Hi Gareth, Have you discussed this with your rep? ^Clark
No, I'm not sure he can make the building work cease for 2 weeks. Surely you appreciate this is not what we were looking for when we booked?
HI Harjinder, How can I help with the email conformation? ^Lucy
As well as passports
HI Harjinder, How can I help with the email conformation? ^Lucy
Do I just need to take the email confirmation to the airport, as online checking isn't working for my flight?
Hi Gary, How can I help? ^Lucy

Right!  That's it, you've now broken your own 28 day SLA! You owe me £66!  I'll issue a CCJ against your company director to get this back!
Hi, Our check in staff will be able to assist further with this and reallocate where needed ^Clark
So we defiantly will be together??
@user our son renamed your plane to Nightmare Liner instead of Dream Liner. Rows of 3 seats but won't sit a family of 3 together!

Thomson all of a sudden would no longer honour that. We have the cash back in the end and have rebooked our holiday online however
Hi Natalie, We would advise speaking with our dedicated After Travel team regarding this ^Clark
I have done, as previously mentioned  on my last tweet...the one you just replied to?
Hi Nat, What's your Pre Travel complaint in regards to ? ^Oli

Sent. Please call
Hi Jason, You'll need to email WeddingsSalesenquiries@thomson.co.uk. ^Oli
Thank you Oli. You may need to update your contact us page.
Will they change our seats when we check in then?
And also why would they allocate us 4 different seats across 8 rows?!! Human error?
Hi Gary, We do throughout the year continually review the quality and standards of all our Resorts. ^Oli
Ok just worried because of all the bad reviews
Hi David, Are you currently in resort? ^Luke
In case you are still there we're just boarding two hours after original departure time
Hi, Please visit one of our retail stores and they will be able to offer advise and quotes for you. ^Brenda
We don't have one where I live anymore. Google it is!
Hi Peter, Once the check in allocation has been reached the remaining passengers. ^Oli
Thanks Oli but I do not understand why some passengers can check in but others cannot on the same flight.
Hi Claire, Our online check in would be full, therefore you need to check in at the airport. ^Rebecca
Why ????? Why is it full at 8am on the day it opened? Why was I told it wasn't working and problem with all online check in ????????
Hi Johm, All aircraft's are only planned and not confirmed as this can change for operational reasons ^Clark
so 4 flights sold as dreamliner, and not one of them actually a dreamliner, am I unlucky or are they really that unreliable??
Hi Kirstie, We never guarantee that online check in will be available for every package ^Clark
May I also advise your WEBSITE is also incorrect. This is not good enough and I will be taking this matter further. Lie after lie. No help.
Hi, We would aim to keep children under 12 next to at least one adult on the booking under the CAA guidelines. ^Brenda
Will they change our seats when we check in then?
Hi Kirstie, We never guarantee that online check in will be available for every package ^Clark
Not true!Another fob off.I suggest you amend all documentation you send to customers advising this is possible and when.It is a lie!
Hi Natalie, If you are unhappy with the response you will need to continue to liaise with the After Travel Team. ^Katie
No excuses for next time. Sent this complaint off yesterday (recorded delivery AGAIN). Proof so you lot can't lie to me again Hi Olivia, Did you receive an automatic ticket number from the email you sent to us? ^Rebecca
Yes

Nope stuck at MAH where we have been since 0923 (local) when the inbound flight was still on the ground in the UK
Hi Rachael, The online check in can close before or after the one week to departure mark ^Luke
Point still stands that the only way to guarantee online check in is to prepay for seats therefore not complimentary.
Hi Lee, If you could please email cares@thomson.co.uk we can look into this for you ^Luke
Wow common sense has disappeared! I just want an update from the chase up of my vouchers
Disgusting, bad enough you had to complain at all but their customer service is appalling!

david.burling@thomson.co.uk as well as other directors emails no one answers
Hi Kate, Please email cares@thomson.co.uk so we can look into this for you ^Luke
We have been emailing you on that address almost every day for the last 4.5 months. But there's still no answer or update on our case.
Hi Andy, I'm sorry to hear about this. Did you raise your concerns at the airport? ^Luke
It was more the fact that it would've been clear that it was broken and the lack of care at which it would've been loaded.
Hi Andy, I'm sorry to hear about this. Did you raise your concerns at the airport? ^Luke
I tried Luke, but to be honest, the Greek staff at the Airport weren't too bothered & the Thomson staff were loading return passengers.
Hi, I've already booked our hotel through you but flights separately. Now just need transfers to and from the airport each way.
Hi - are you able to help??
@user sent a flight delay claim over 2 months ago and no response after the specified '56' days, am i ever going to get a reply?

Top choice, Stacy. Is that for the kids or just for you?!
@user why don't u offer a proper loyalty scheme? Just get people to extend 12 month / 18 month contracts in return for discount etc
(2/2) But it's an interesting suggestion that we'll definitely pass on to the Sky VIP team
@user why don't u offer a proper loyalty scheme? Just get people to extend 12 month / 18 month contracts in return for discount etc
We wanted to make Sky VIP more about rewards & experiences rather than discounts (1/2)
Watching Beauty & the Beast courtesy of our @user VIP reward. Cheers @user  Must be a lot warmer doing an indoor cinema night, Jess. Great shout on Beauty & the Beast & welcome to Sky VIP 
@user thinking that the tickets on Sky VIP scheme are all being taken by SKY staff! None available ever. VIP scheme is worst ever!!
(2/2) there will be lots more opportunities to get tickets to events as we release more tickets over time

Loved it when I phoned @user the other day that as a VIP Black member I was put through within a minute unlike waiting half hour One of the many perks of being in Sky VIP Black, Keith. We hope we managed to sort everything out just as quickly 
Thanks for the tickets to see @user V @user @user  @user Not a bad way to spend an evening. That is a wonderful way to spend a Thursday. What a good thing the game was yesterday rather than on Wednesday 
Great experience with @user - loyalty mattered. Normal wait time 30 mins, VIP wait time 2 mins. Friendly UK staff who exceeded expectations
Great to hear that we could sort everything for you so quickly, Ian. How are you liking Sky VIP so far?

Welcome to Sky VIP, Alastair. So glad to see you're already enjoying the rewards on offer - there will be a lot more to come as well 
@user Hello. Glad to see VIP is running. Perhaps a free upgrade to Boxset package (or at least existing channels in HD) would be poss?
Great to see you're all signed up. It's not something we've got planned but that's great feedback to get. We'll pass this on to the team Ben
They chose Nativity 2, far too early for the Christmas movies but they find the Nativity movies hilarious  Thanks again :)

You kept that quiet @user Hey Sheryl, have you been able to sign up to Sky VIP? Let us know if you need any help getting registered

We'll be releasing new rewards all the time through but that's good to know. We'll make sure we pass your feedback on to the team
So I thought I was lucky having Sky VIP Silver status. My parents are Black level. Ugh.
Well the longer you're with us, the better Sky VIP gets. Hopefully you'll be able to get the same rewards as your parents soon 
@user Excellent work from your engineer Martyn today to get us back up and running.

Even told me about   and I signed up.
Great to hear that you're back up & running and that you've signed up to Sky VIP! Have you started redeeming your rewards?
Good of @user to reward loyal customers  but fully booked, fully booked, fully booked... get the idea.
We'll be releasing new tickets to events up & down the country. Make sure you check your My Sky app weekly for new updates

Facebook twitter and the whole of the Internet is full of spoilers and illegal downloads of  wonder if @user put it on demand early
HBO Spain accidentally did it themselves
He may have activated the equipment however it can take up to 24 hours for it to fully activate. NB
Please read back what you said it makes no sense FML why did i leave @user women per yr in England & Wales are raped.15% of those who experience sexual violence report it. We have a problem w/ men raping women.
We have also a problem with our laws stopping women being charged with rape (on men) even though they're found guilty of the crime

Likewise mate 

Don't you get BT sport free though? With virgin
Who likes their internet deal and who is it with as I'm with @user and it's dog shit
Switching to virgin was the worst thing I ever did! I cannot wait to go back to @user in October! They are referring to Openreach. Your provider would contact openreach on your behalf. We do the same for BT customers.  ^Shane
But @user can't provide a date surely I should be assigned a case manager @user this stage?We are paying for a service! .@bt_uk .@BTCare
We have had no communication from you-  just @user notifying there has been 'a delay' from your end. When will this be resolved? .@bt_uk
They are referring to Openreach. Your provider would contact openreach on your behalf. We do the same for BT customers.  ^Shane
Sorry to hear that. Are the order due to get back to you with an update on this? ^Shane
We have had no communication from you-  just @user notifying there has been 'a delay' from your end. When will this be resolved? .@bt_uk
How do I go about registering and seeing something done about @user @user Andrew, if you're able to provide a bit more information about your problem, we can point you in the right direction. Thanks
Sopranos Box Sets S1-6 are available on demand now. How’s that for an offer you can’t refuse?Is this coming back? Started watching it last week & it has now vanished.
Some of us have jobs to do so can't sit on the app all day some kind on notification would be good  @user checking everyday for a week at least every 15/20 mins completely sold out. Dodgy this
One of my girlfriends says size doesn't matter.  I disagree @user was lying
@user terrible service have phoned sky numerous times about my broadband connection being terrible 1hr 10 mins still couldnt get throughpic.twitter.com/tSZLrhQYjG
Was told to connect wire straight to phone socket now my phone won't work and my connection still sucks
4th episode was a bit emotional but interesting 
Yes 4th episode had an important social msg  loved the way episode unfolds
@user @user @user @user who is responsible for green boxes outside house full of wires? Concerned is open and dangerous.pic.twitter.com/egNer5JbHy
I thought this may have been an @user box Ki.
Some of us have jobs to do so can't sit on the app all day some kind on notification would be good  @user seemed to go in seconds. Sorry but the whole thing looks like a PR stunt. Don't have time to work and sit on an app all day refreshing
Their bundle is also far cheaper and offers more than @user They've given me VIP status yet can't offer the products as a result! Jokers
Sounds worth a try. When Virgin works it's good, when it's broken you're on your own though.
Hi mate, good thanks. I use Virgin but would never recommend them as their service is terrible. You moved house or something?
Their bundle is also far cheaper and offers more than @user They've given me VIP status yet can't offer the products as a result! Jokers
After reading  I've been looking forward to watching the TV series. Why aren't all the episodes still available @user will be on 4od surely?

I still don't understand why we need all this cheap Chinese plastic ? What about glass ?
It's good to see that Sky has figured out what is wrong with my internet.  I might regret cancelling with @user and going with @user I didn't include sky in my list of companies that do good work with broadband haha
China will disintegrate like USSR
True & likely in 18-42 months from now, k bye am in train & catch up soon
@user Why have Sky VIP test series tickets changed from more coming to fully booked in a blink of an eye? Did these tickets actually exist?
All seems a bit cloak n dagger me thinks
This is known as political compulsions , you know everything but say something else
China will disintegrate like USSR
@user I have been refreshing every 15 minutes on sky VIP app for test match tickets then all of a sudden fully booked how can its not fair
I messaged them today to say exactly that and asked what time they were released think it's all a con I've been checking constantly@O2  yay thanks for the update to the priority about the miles 
No worries, give us a shout if there's anything else we can help with 
Just sent DM

@user If I'm using o2 travel from California, USA, is the midnight cut off Sacramento time GMT-8 (capital of state) or Washington DC GMT-5?
Hi there, it would be based on your current location not the capital. We hope this helps :)

@user I have a sim only deal with you. Been with you for years Why can I not just buy a phone if I already have a tariff?

Okay. Do you disable data while on Wi-Fi? If not and your Wi-Fi connection drops, your phone will switch to mobile data.
Can you not add it back on?
What type of discount was it exactly? Did you ask us about this discount at the time of upgrading?
@user complete joke. Messed up my phone agreed this compensation within 14 days.  Rang when it wasnt put in and they say they have no recordpic.twitter.com/7HRaD4I6p2
We've just replied to your DM 
Well done @user for only taking over a month to issue a refund of £480!!!
Couldn't run a piss up in a brewery comes to mind...pic.twitter.com/VfgJwS3r0s
Hi there.  What was the refund for? Have you received the money back now? What happened? DM us@user hi, I'm on O2 contract, how much to use my phone/contract in Turkey please?
Hi Steve, you can use O2 Travel for £3.99 per day in Turkey. More info here >I've done that now and changed tariffs :) no way I can get the money back from my bolt ons from this month?
Ah, we're glad you've been able to do that!  We wouldn't be able to refund the money for a bolt-on that was already applied.
The signal round here isn't actually strong enough to load it. It's only around EC2 as soon as I go even to old street things start loading!
 We're unaware of any issues in the general area. DM us with the full postcode and we'll take a closerdone!
We've replied to your DM

 Check out our network tips here Lauren:Yes location is on but on every offer on the app says my nearest location is London and I'm in sheffield. It recently updated so I think so
Okay, could you check if the app is on the 3.0.2 update?

Hi there,
How can I change my address on my priority app?
Hey Sophie. We're a little unsure what you mean. Do you have your location services on? Have you got the latest version?
@user  might cost me more in travel costs than I save with these Priority offers!!pic.twitter.com/vHQCeqfb6f
 Do you have the latest version of the app Colin? Are your location settings turned on? Let us know, we'd like to help.
I can't get 4G in Italy, 3G is as slow as E never had it this bad    @user there. We don't currently have a 4G roaming agreement in Europe. Have you tried manually selecting alternative networks?

 Have you spoken directly with our upgrades team about your options? Are you running out of data each month currently?
So I upgrade my tariff and @user  decide to remove my discount. Having a laugh if they think I'm paying £62.00 phone bill
 Any discounts do automatically get removed when a new upgrade is processed, as you're taking out a new deal.
I haven't received a number @user said I should receive my parcel 15th Aug but it never came and I didn't get an email from you.
We've replied to your DM Charlotte.
Hi, I have updated to the latest version and everything is back to normal now, thank you
Ah, great stuff Steven. If you need anything else, let us know.
Messaged you. Hardly doubt your be able to help about 6 others members of your team couldnt cook a egg if required.
We've replied to your DM.
I just wanted them (o2) to put me onto the same deal that is on their (o2) homepage - exactly the same as mine but £10 cheaper 
We've just replied to your DM.
@user you need to fix o2 WiFi, how can anyone use it if you require sms confirmation. Only reason I use it as don't have signal.
Have you registered for use on O2 Wi-Fi prior to this Blake? Are you trying to connect to one particular hotspot? DMMoving to @user after years with @user 2 month left on my contract and they won't change my sim deal without a full phone upgrade. Cheers.
We've replied to your DM

@user why, with full 4g coverage and full bars on phone, do my incoming calls go straight to voicemail? Thanks.
 Check out our network tips here Kevin:Yes but I've been on refresh for 6years and never had to pay the full device plan.
We'd always offer the best deal we could, however, the current device plan would need to be fully paid in order to upgrade.

Hey Anil.  Speeds can vary when roaming as you're connecting to a foreign network. The highest band available is 3G.
That's not very good my cousin is on EE and he get 4G, I know this as we go together.  why do you put restrictions in place?
Hi Rich, you're able to update contact preferences in MyO2. Please sign in here for this >@user I'd suggest you allow people to 'opt in' for this kinda stuff. Just an idea!
Hi there. We don't currently have a 4G roaming agreement in Europe. Have you tried manually selecting alternative networks?
@user any timescale for removing restrictions- call/chat said wb 22 august - true?
I was just wondering why they keep calling? When I google the number it suggests it's spa@

I put a Vodafone sim in it last night before I went to bed after turning it off. Switched it on this morning with the Vodafone sim did that
 Which phone have you got there? Also, have you had a non O2 SIM in the phone since it's been unlocked?

Okay, complete this form here:they say it takes 2 days to be able to activate. Doesn’t say that on leaflet. Would have saved me a lot of time if it did :)
Ah right. You'd be unable to retrieve these details form a deleted voicemail. We're sorry for the inconvenience.
What a bag of daz
Hi Hannah  Please see our network guide for help with this here:Yeah Han,do as your told.
How strange, are you able to call us? You can find our contact details hereVery strange! Got their in the end, Terence is on point! [2/2] make sure that the lack of a demo available is passed on to the store. >AI

 Hi Nick, do you know what time this was? If so, have you checked your recent calls list to see if it shows as a missed call?
There's nothing in the call register but this was today & they left message name & number
Hi .@O2 
I really don't appreciate being cold called...Especially when you pretend not to be selling anything. Still, I got Kelly to hang up
It's obviously your fault you're getting calls you didn't want.
It's not working from either my laptop or my phone @userWhat can we say? Not all heroes wear capes  Download the latest version and you should be good to go!
Cracking!! That other telecoms firm that always brag biggest fastest will be grEEn with envy!

 Are you coming to us from another network Debbie? Have you been in touch with us about this? DM us some moreIve hopefully now resolved this. It has taken 1 week and my number was not put through your ABS System. The error occurred in your end
Okay. Do you disable data while on Wi-Fi? If not and your Wi-Fi connection drops, your phone will switch to mobile data.
yes its always turned off when im on wifi
Well @user it's been a (mainly) great 18 years together, ever since you were a baby as BT Cellnet, but it's time for me to move on. Farewell

No I gave up after 20 minutes.
 Do you have the latest version of the app Colin? Are your location settings turned on? Let us know, we'd like to help.
Apps auto update. Version 3.0.1 locations enabled while using. It's on startup that it goes nuts, it sorts itself out after a bit.
@user I cannot continue as a customer if you fund hate by advertising in The Mail, Express or Sun. Please @user Hello! Are you alive? I'm worried about you: a multinational telecommunications company that can't respond to a simple tweet.
 Have you checked your data usage in your settings to see what's using the most data? Has this ever happened before?
yeah it says ive used it all, but on one day there was a huge jump and im on wifi 90% of the day so i have no idea & its never happened be4
 Any discounts do automatically get removed when a new upgrade is processed, as you're taking out a new deal.
Can you not add it back on?
 We're sorry you missed out this time, keep checking Priority for more offers.
I will when I can get it to load 
Hi Rach. You'd always be able to check what alternative tariffs are available for you on your My O2:I've done that now and changed tariffs :) no way I can get the money back from my bolt ons from this month?Yes yes im sure its fine ive got 14 days to decide if i stay or go
If you remain unhappy with this please see our complaints code of practice NB
I stayed in on 28/7 and when I called to check, Construction said it was unnecessary. Install team on 29/7 said it was.
Have you been able to escalate this with our team as per our complaints code of practice? NB
Have a lovely evening Gavin. LB
Yes, I asked your colleague to send an amended bill and received the same one as the one I queried.
We aren't able to send an amended bill as they're auto generated Mike but we should have been able to confirm the...I'll give @user their hour 
Ok, our team will still be available after that time if you need them :-) NB
Nothing was said apart from the engineer said he didn't know what the issue could be!
It would be best to give our team a call on 150 / 0345 454 1111 so that we can look into this further. LB
I'm fine if never turning up or being late without calling is your bag , sleep well NB, I can only apologise for this, if you do wish to raise this further our team can assist with this. NB
Reckon we'd be able to get a broadband and TV installation sorted before 24th and 26th respectively?
If you are able to give our team a call on 0800 183 1234 they can  check this for you. NB
If you can provide such good speed and TV why us the backend of operations done on the cheap with WD40'and Garda tape. Your better than this
I am sorry to hear you feel that way. I am afraid that is the process when it comes to receiving and sending the ...Are you really bothered ? If you guys were that bothered wouldn't have to wait 2 days for an engineer to come back after only just leaving
The team would've given the earliest available appointment. NB
Thanks! Will do
No worries :-) NB
A blockage that was there on 13/7. They claim work commenced 29/7 and will take x weeks. No groundwork to my home yet either
Did they say they would keep in contact to update you with any changes? NB
It's all well and good getting "100MBS broadband" but when you've got a shite hub it's useless @user can't wait to switch to BT
Sorry you feel that way, Jordan. ^CC

Hi Sarah, I'm very sorry for any inconvenience this work is causing. We will get this completed as quickly as possible. LB
This is even worse. Never an agent available. Maybe if I just cancel my direct debit?
Apologies, sometimes the queues are high, have you tried calling us directly? ^CC
Both.!! TV hard wired and useless
Ah ok, have you been able to speak with our team regarding these issues? NB
About 3 weeks ago when a TiVo box was installed in a second room
Could you expand on what the engineer advised? Did they say what we could do moving forward to look into this further? LB
If you thought @user was a scam, try the "Premium Wifi" 30 Euro per week service @user in Napitia.  It's 1.1mb here Hi Mike! Anything we can help you out with? ^DC
@user and @user feel free to get in touch one hour from now, just in case @user haven't been so helpful... I'm sorry to hear this Greg, please do give us a shout if you need anything. NB
They said everything is activated and running fine there side
Ah ok, if that is the case then the engineer that is coming will be able to investigate what is causing this. Let...Not much, they say each month it will be investigated and nothing, then issue repeated.. never a sorry/compensation. I have changed DD date
Have our team confirmed this is an issue on our side and not with the bank? LB
Your retention team sorted me an good deal, I'm getting V6 Box and 300mb £10 cheaper
I'm glad to hear our team could help Daniel. Let us know what you think of the new V6 box and we'e here if you need us. LB
Will do
Give us a shout if you need anything else. NB
Thank your! A company that actually talks to its customers! Should have done this a long long time ago!
The main thing is you're here now and I'm sure you'll never look back. We're here 7 days a week if you need us. LB
Do read the thread simpleton    if hanging around all day for an am apptt is sorted then..
If you remain unhappy with this Martin please see our complaints code of practice here NB
I took a day off work today now ive got to take anova day off friday just because your engineers aint done there job properly
Have you been able to ask the team if the activation is till going through? NB
months sorry- not years
\No problem James, I am afraid when it comes to accounts with us such as your fathers, when the service is ended ...Last time (yesterday) it was 6-8 weeks. On Monday it was 4-6 from the failed install on 29/7. No mention of the failed install on 15/7
Have the team given a reason as to why there is a delay with this? NB
So I've made the switch to @user thanks to @user with a banging deal!Fancy it? Drop him a tweet and he'll sort you out! 
Welcome on board Gavin. :) If you need anything just give us a shout. LB
@user hi our remotes not working properly how do i go about getting a new one? Ive had it since i got virgin so around 5+ years
Hello Matthew, thank you for your tweet. If you call the team on 150/0345 454 1111 they'll be happy to order one ...Your very good at not taking any responsibility! Fuck it that's it 
We are unable to empty the bins for you, you would need to contact the council so they can arrange for these to be emptied. NB
@user We are sadly moving to an area that Virgin Media doesn't cover. Can you confirm I'm out of contract and how much notice u need?
Oh no, that is a shame. :( We would require 30 days notice for any cancellation. Our team on 150 / 0345 454 1111 ...I didn't follow well, thought your colleague reduced the bill to £1.72, then received PDF back to £17. Struggled to understand her English.
Was the bill received the same day as you had the conversation Mike? If a credit is applied after the bill has be...None at all. Even an engineer couldn't work out the issue
Have you had an engineer visit about this recently Paul? LB
Please read back what you said it makes no sense FML why did i leave @user the engineer has requested for the equipment to be activated it may not fully activate for up to 24 hours. NB
It didn't. It's running a test on my home, if it's still not working, phone back in 10 mins. No option to speak to a person
It would run this test first Duncan, if you give our team another call it will let you speak with an advisor. LB
Yes. Getting between 35 & 38mb when promised 100mb
Are there any issues listed on our service page that could account for this: LB
I keep being told 4-6 weeks - I've alreAdy waited longer than that
Apologies for this, what have our team advised regarding this when you spoke with them last? NB
The link take me to a test page... not a page I can get a quicker appointment
When did you speak to the team, was it today? ^CC
no agents for online chat, phone line won't even ring and no email address. How do I contact you @user to hear that. The phone line should always ring. what number are you dialling? ^CC
Engineer installed everything at 12.00 and before leaving said everything was activated and running fine
He may have activated the equipment however it can take up to 24 hours for it to fully activate. NB
When do the new beefed up compensation arrangements take effect?
Sorry to hear that, have you spoken to a member of our faults team regarding this? They can be reached at 0345 454 1111. ^CC
Ahhhh my bad! I hope @user can help 
Hey Sean, I'm sorry to hear this. Are you due to be moving the services over to your new address or are you looki...missing the point it should cost me to find out why and how long my services are down plus it proves how poor your customers services are
Sorry you feel that way. The link is quite useful and to the point. ^CC
The wifi will not connect to the server and it's being very temperamental :(
Are there any issues listed on our service page that could account for this: LB
Fuck the council there all bent ! Your the problem leaving the street in this mess
This is something we would not be able to arrange i'm afraid. NB
@user I have someone coming next week to fix my issue but it's still happening a lot. Very annoyed. Can I have some discount please.
Hi there, thanks for your post. if you give our team a call they can check this for you as per our credit guideli...But we've had problems before and it said similar things like this many times before and it didn't get fixed on the day
Apologies for this. We do aim to get faults fixed by the estimated time. Our team will be working hard to ensure this is the case. ^Ben
It's automated, I need to speak to someone, a system test is pretty useless
If you follow the option for TV technical help it will give you the option to speak with an advisor once you run ...Yes but the internet is not working, they said they cant see anything wrong on there side
When was the equipment activated as it can take up to 24 hours for it to activate. NB
Not even getting half of the internet speed promised to me
Are you having issues on both a wired and wireless connection? LB
Already done everything you'll  ask
Are you having trouble with a wired connection as well? ^Ben
For me it's the download speed and wifi coverage.! Really poor like being in the 1990's. Old TV box that takes ages to get catch up Tv.
Are you getting these speed issues via a wired or wireless connection? NB
Then you need to reeducate your customer service team as to what they should be telling customers.
Apologies if this is what you have been advised. NB
I have. But I'm paying you. So, i think you owe me an apology as well.
I am very sorry about this and that this happened to you. Are you able to advise what has happened, just so I can understand PJ. CD
No I didn't realise I needed to so I didn't do it until I'd left.
Are calls and texts working? ^MK
Yes but not good enough its been 4hrs since engineer came to install equipment
Has the equipment been activated? NB
Happy to do that but surely I can’t just remove all of your hardware? Don’t I have to leave something of yours in place to be in modem mode?
i would advise having a look at our forums for further information from our technical experts regarding this NB
Gantoh
Bit confused with your last response HP ^GT
Yes thanks works but will try when I get home
Okay, we're here if you need us. ^MK
I'd rather make a mess of your car park like u have my street 
If you do wish to have this resolved the council will be the best bet to have this resolved. NB
So so many times and I am just told the service is down and will b repaired in .... hrs etc.
When was the last time you called us? ^GT
I had an engineer booked for Tuesday and YOU cancelled him! Supposedly a network fault.  I'm now another 3 days waiting
The link is there if there is an opportunity to move the date earlier. ^CC
Have been promised compensation. It'll need to be good to keep me as a customer. Nearing the final straw with this.
We wouldn't offer compensation only a loss of service credit as per our credit guidelines NB
Spoke to someone on the phone who left me baffled. Which is why I'd prefer e-mail or chat. Even direct message here would be ok.
We don't have access to the DM facility I'm afraid, what did they advise you during the call Mike? RP
can i like pay money for it to go faster?
i know it's lame, but internet is like the most important thing to me
It may be that the connections we need are locked away and the flat manager would be the only person with access ^GT
When you get an email from @user about a price increase when they can't even fulfil what they promise Hi Paul, I can appreciate that a price increase is never welcome news. Are you having issues with the services at the moment? LB
@user its taken 4hrs since switching over from @user to call about my internet not working, Friday is the quickest for callout 
I'm sorry to hear this Edson, has this engineer visit been booked for you now then? NB
@user Hey, my internet and tv is down and the status page says everything's good?
Hi there. Sorry to hear this. How long have you been having this issue? ^Ben
my phone and I don't see why I should have to waste my phone data navigating your website I pay you to provide me not the other way around
The site is there to provide you with information if there is an outage as well as do some diagnostics if that is needed. ^CC
dont worry...
No problem Connor, if there is anything we can help with just let us know. LB
Yes, already spent ages on phone to VM today
Thankyou ^GT
That was totally pointless. Made me do a hard reset and now have to set everything back up with and still have the same issue.
Thanks for calling Carl, what did our team advise we can do moving forward to get this sorted since the hard reset didn't work? LB
Each time it was 'escalated' to the highways team to get the pipe put in, but obviously not as I had over an hours worth of calls today
Very sorry to hear this Matt. Have the guys who came arranged for the additional work to be completed before the next appointment? ^MK
@user is the worst.!! @user has had bad experiences with virgin.!! Virgin service in Bristol is very very poor.!!
I'm sorry to hear you feel that way James, are you able to elaborate on your issue so we can assist? NB
I'm already getting them. I spoke to tech support yesterday. See my earlier email about their nonsense reason for the outage.
If there are any further updates we will keep you notified via text. NB
@user If I want to use modem mode and utilise my own router, do you offer a smaller piece of hardware as an alternative to Hub 3.0?
Hi there Gareth, we don't unfortunately. You would need to purchase this. NB
I restarted and it got better but it fluctuates so much, not very reliable.
Are the speeds effected over both wired and wireless connections Oliver? RP

Can you let us know how this goes ^GT
Umm should be VM keeping me informed no?
You can opt to have text notifications set up if you are able to give our team a call. NB
@user your @user people lied to me. How do I complain.
Hi, thanks for your post. I am very sorry to hear this. You would have to log that complaint with Yodel, may I ask you what has happened. CD
I will check when I get back home. Thanks for your help with this.
No worries, let us know if you need anything else. NB
My virgin media broadband? Thank you
Hello Billy, sorry to hear of the broadband issues you're experiencing. If you could elaborate we're here to help. RP
I was told Virgin would be contacting them in the next couple of days (I'd appreciate it if that could be asap, really).
We will be working as fast as we can to get this sorted Richard. ^GT
@user 43 minutes on the phone, transferred 5 times and still couldn't help me! YOU ARE A JOKE
Oh no! Sorry to hear this Adam. What was it you were calling for? ^MK
@user can you send me a quote for removing a VMcable, stating your call-out charge? Need it written & it's not stated on your website
Hi Amy, you would have to ring the customer service team to arrange this, they can be reached at 0345 454 1111. ^CC
U fucking ring um I've tried loads !
Maybe when there's rubbish in your car park u might do something 
If you contact the council they can arrange the binmen to come tomorrow. NB
Basically hub 3 software not fully functional, as known, but no attempts to rectify this. Customer Issues not important it seems.
Very sorry about this Charlie, we'd always aim to offer the best service we can. ^AR
Yes it is a home landline
Would you be okay to call us please 0345 454 1111 ^GT
Argh! Just received the annual @user bill price hike letter. Will be switching before that comes in. Too much for poor performance.

How are you communicating to us now? ^CC
@user who do I speak to about keeping my current deal without it doubling in price next month or I'm switching to @user ?
You can speak to us for prices that won't double Steph ^GT
Thanks  bloody Virgin Media for writing to tell me you're increasing my monthly bill again!!
Sorry about that Howard, we wouldn't if we didn't have to. ^MK
A big huge massive thank u to Anna at the Welwyn Garden branch of @user she's just changed my life!
That's amazing Molly, can you elaborate so we can pass this on to Anna? RP
Yesterday I waited all day for a delivery which arrived at 2.30pm TODAY, now waiting for the Virgin media man, spend my whole life waiting!
Hi Lyn, I am sorry to hear that this has happened. Can you please let us know how you get on with the visit from ...Was told 24 hrs on Monday 5pm!
Is this for a home telephone line? ^GT
Have done thanks and it's going to be fixed at midnight according to it...
We will be sure to have you back up and running as soon as possible. Apologies again for the downtime. ^MK
No worries, hope it gets sorted for you. NB
ThAts better...old school turn off and on again!pic.twitter.com/7i4E7zwQpM
Hi Lynne, let me know if this is the case this morning? ^RF
Still no service was told it was planned maintenance in the area on Monday today have been told there's been no maintence in the area !!!!
Have you been able to escalate this with our team as per our complaints code of practice? NB
Yesterday I was offered to have it escalated. Rajive said he'd send some emails on 2/8. Don't think he did as he wouldn't take my calls.
I had the new SuperHub fitted and its range is worse than the old one. Devices keep disconnecting, happening for 6 months.
They told me to connect to only 2g as the 5g is not a good connection, and 2g reaches a wider range. They were right, been fab since 
Ah, hopefully the business team will be able to get this resolved for you. ^Ben
basically just pied you off to a different team again, good work
Hey Sean, I'm sorry to hear this. Are you due to be moving the services over to your new address or are you looki...New address and potential new customer! One of your advisors already mentioned something about a capacity lock until maybe mid September 
Apologies, sometimes the queues are high, have you tried calling us directly? ^CC
I'm paying for a service I don't recieve
If you remain unhappy with this please see our complaints code of practice NB
No need to thanks, im within my 14 days
Did they say they would keep in contact to update you with any changes? NB
Still waiting for the call back promised by Ishwadh yesterday. And the one promised by Rajive Fernandez on 2/8.
Apologies, sometimes the queues are high, have you tried calling us directly? ^CC
I've tried everything, I now have a phone bill from being on hold for so long. Chat you never get on either. It's ridiculous
Hi Lyn, I am sorry to hear that this has happened. Can you please let us know how you get on with the visit from ...@user media We are still waiting!!
Have a lovely evening Gavin. LB
Cheers! You too!
Oh no, that is a shame. :( We would require 30 days notice for any cancellation. Our team on 150 / 0345 454 1111 ...Thank you 
The team would've given the earliest available appointment. NB
Yes yes im sure its fine ive got 14 days to decide if i stay or go
Good news.  On the  near  we've completed the bridge repair.  Closed lane has re-opened. Safe journey! Shame you can't apply the same sense of urgency to sorting out the @user trench on  adjacent A2/A2260 off slip at Springhead.pic.twitter.com/Lx3UiNfen5
Very sorry about the disruption Janine. We'll be sure to come fix it sooner if possible. ^MK
Could you please DM me
How much you pay Stace? I'm with them. Costs me £75 a month
I only needed it for the aerial & broadband. I don't have any of the package channels, it's freeview basically & I pay £50 a month
Did they say they would keep in contact to update you with any changes? NB
I stayed in on 28/7 and when I called to check, Construction said it was unnecessary. Install team on 29/7 said it was.
No worries :-) NB
I'll give @user their hour 
The main thing is you're here now and I'm sure you'll never look back. We're here 7 days a week if you need us. LB
Was the bill received the same day as you had the conversation Mike? If a credit is applied after the bill has be...Yes, I asked your colleague to send an amended bill and received the same one as the one I queried.
Did they say they would keep in contact to update you with any changes? NB
They have said it frequently. Callbacks on 24-48 hours offered. None happened. On 27/7 I was told groundwork at home on 28/8
If you remain unhappy with this Martin please see our complaints code of practice here NB
I'm fine if never turning up or being late without calling is your bag , sleep well NB, Sorry you feel that way, Jordan. ^CC
Any plans for a stronger more reliable hub anytime soon?
Are you having trouble with a wired connection as well? ^Ben
Yes is awful. Tv has to use ethernet cable no signal on phone
Could you expand on what the engineer advised? Did they say what we could do moving forward to look into this further? LB
Nothing was said apart from the engineer said he didn't know what the issue could be!
Thanks! Will do
Reckon we'd be able to get a broadband and TV installation sorted before 24th and 26th respectively?
Maybe one day I'll come home to a letter from @user saying my bill is going down..ha yea right. Two price increases in a year How much you pay Stace? I'm with them. Costs me £75 a month
Ah ok, if that is the case then the engineer that is coming will be able to investigate what is causing this. Let...Are you really bothered ? If you guys were that bothered wouldn't have to wait 2 days for an engineer to come back after only just leaving
I'm sorry to hear this Greg, please do give us a shout if you need anything. NB
Thanks! Will do
@user @user i can't get virgin in this block of flats  gutted x
Have the team given a reason as to why there is a delay with this? NB
A blockage that was there on 13/7. They claim work commenced 29/7 and will take x weeks. No groundwork to my home yet either
Are you getting these speed issues via a wired or wireless connection? NB
Both.!! TV hard wired and useless
I'm sorry to hear this. What have our team advised about this payment failing each month. LB
Not much, they say each month it will be investigated and nothing, then issue repeated.. never a sorry/compensation. I have changed DD date
We would be sad to see you leave us. Our team will be able to discuss any available deals and process this cancel...Your retention team sorted me an good deal, I'm getting V6 Box and 300mb £10 cheaper
Arrange a call within the next hour or I'll very happily execute my cooling off period notice after this shambles...
@user and @user feel free to get in touch one hour from now, just in case @user haven't been so helpful... Have you been able to ask the team if the activation is till going through? NB
They said everything is activated and running fine there side
Have you had an engineer visit about this recently Paul? LB
About 3 weeks ago when a TiVo box was installed in a second room
Welcome on board Gavin. :) If you need anything just give us a shout. LB
Thank your! A company that actually talks to its customers! Should have done this a long long time ago!
Ronaldo did a Messi and United captured the league in August, these are the headlines from the weekend! Virgin media utter crap ripping people off with charging peoples bills twice
Ah this isn't great to hear Debs, are you able to report this via the following link? NB
Will do
If the engineer has requested for the equipment to be activated it may not fully activate for up to 24 hours. NB
I took a day off work today now ive got to take anova day off friday just because your engineers aint done there job properly
Thanks for your reply James, how long ago was it your father ended his services with us? CD
months sorry- not years
Are you getting these speed issues via a wired or wireless connection? NB
Good luck James. Took me four months, and threats to take them to court, before they *finally* cancelled a contract I hadn't asked for.
Sorry about that Howard, we wouldn't if we didn't have to. ^MK
Oops!!But do you  'have'to?
Apologies for this, what have our team advised regarding this when you spoke with them last? NB
Last time (yesterday) it was 6-8 weeks. On Monday it was 4-6 from the failed install on 29/7. No mention of the failed install on 15/7
This is something we would not be able to arrange i'm afraid. NB
Your very good at not taking any responsibility! Fuck it that's it 
We don't have access to the DM facility I'm afraid, what did they advise you during the call Mike? RP
I didn't follow well, thought your colleague reduced the bill to £1.72, then received PDF back to £17. Struggled to understand her English.
Are there any issues listed on our service page that could account for this: LB
None at all. Even an engineer couldn't work out the issue
Have you opted out of them before? If not you can do so here- ^AR
Ooh! I phoned up and it did no good. Thanks!
Sorry you feel that way. The link is quite useful and to the point. ^CC
its a valid point if your services are down many people cannot access the site as there services are down and don't have internet access
He may have activated the equipment however it can take up to 24 hours for it to fully activate. NB
Please read back what you said it makes no sense FML why did i leave @user link is there if there is an opportunity to move the date earlier. ^CC
The link take me to a test page... not a page I can get a quicker appointment
If you follow the option for TV technical help it will give you the option to speak with an advisor once you run ...It didn't. It's running a test on my home, if it's still not working, phone back in 10 mins. No option to speak to a person
I'm sorry about what's happened here with your install, IS Knight. it sounds like the communication between the d...I keep being told 4-6 weeks - I've alreAdy waited longer than that
Thanks for your reply James, how long ago was it your father ended his services with us? CD
Thanks for yours too CD- multiple number of years ago!
When was the last time you called us? ^GT
Bout two weeks ago and it's so difficult to do so
I'm sorry about what's happened here with your install, IS Knight. it sounds like the communication between the d...I understand these things take time - I originally took the contract out mid June - Two months ago and no work had occurred.
I am very sorry about this and that this happened to you. Are you able to advise what has happened, just so I can understand PJ. CD
If you can provide such good speed and TV why us the backend of operations done on the cheap with WD40'and Garda tape. Your better than this
Are you having issues on both a wired and wireless connection? LB
Yes. Getting between 35 & 38mb when promised 100mb
We can certainly get this fed back for you Martin. just to confirm has this now been resolved for you? NB
Do read the thread simpleton    if hanging around all day for an am apptt is sorted then..
Are calls and texts working? ^MK
They don't appear to be
When was the equipment activated as it can take up to 24 hours for it to activate. NB
Engineer installed everything at 12.00 and before leaving said everything was activated and running fine
I am very sorry about this and that this happened to you. Are you able to advise what has happened, just so I can understand PJ. CD
On the cheap? I mean i have to install the box myself and return the TiVo myself. I mean are you looking to save money?
Hi Daniel, what makes you say this? LB
The wifi will not connect to the server and it's being very temperamental :(
If you do wish to have this resolved the council will be the best bet to have this resolved. NB
Fuck the council there all bent ! Your the problem leaving the street in this mess
Hi there. Sorry to hear this. How long have you been having this issue? ^Ben
But we've had problems before and it said similar things like this many times before and it didn't get fixed on the day
It's all well and good getting "100MBS broadband" but when you've got a shite hub it's useless @user can't wait to switch to BT
Switch to BT? I think you need to give your head a shake mate!
New BT fibre service 5.5 Mbps 
Hi, thanks for your post. I am very sorry to hear this. You would have to log that complaint with Yodel, may I ask you what has happened. CD
Plus your customer service in raising a complaint is bad. It's also costing money. When did you start doing delivery and customer service
Hey Sean, looks like you're in the UK our friends @user should be able to assist.  ^Lindsey
Ahhhh my bad! I hope @user can help 
Thanks for trying that. It would be best to give our team a call on 150 / 0345 454 1111 so that we can look into this further. LB
It's automated, I need to speak to someone, a system test is pretty useless
Hi there. Sorry to hear this. How long have you been having this issue? ^Ben
It's been a couple of hours, it says on the status page that there's a engineer on their way and that it will be fixed at 8:20 tonight
The site is there to provide you with information if there is an outage as well as do some diagnostics if that is needed. ^CC
missing the point it should cost me to find out why and how long my services are down plus it proves how poor your customers services are
Has the equipment been activated? NB
Yes but the internet is not working, they said they cant see anything wrong on there side
I'm sorry to hear you feel that way James, are you able to elaborate on your issue so we can assist? NB
For me it's the download speed and wifi coverage.! Really poor like being in the 1990's. Old TV box that takes ages to get catch up Tv.
We wouldn't offer compensation only a loss of service credit as per our credit guidelines NB
Then you need to reeducate your customer service team as to what they should be telling customers.
Hi Paul, I can appreciate that a price increase is never welcome news. Are you having issues with the services at the moment? LB
Not even getting half of the internet speed promised to me
Was it this link you were trying? ^KT
Yes thanks works but will try when I get home
I'm sorry to hear this Edson, has this engineer visit been booked for you now then? NB
Yes but not good enough its been 4hrs since engineer came to install equipment
If you contact the council they can arrange the binmen to come tomorrow. NB
I'd rather make a mess of your car park like u have my street 
Hi there Gareth, we don't unfortunately. You would need to purchase this. NB
Happy to do that but surely I can’t just remove all of your hardware? Don’t I have to leave something of yours in place to be in modem mode?
If there are any further updates we will keep you notified via text. NB
Have been promised compensation. It'll need to be good to keep me as a customer. Nearing the final straw with this.
Hi Erin, sorry about this. Did you activated your roaming on your account before leaving the UK as well as on your handset? ^KT
No I didn't realise I needed to so I didn't do it until I'd left.Yes I am. I

no they don't On top of that they pass on the RPI to their customers if you have signed a contract on or after May 2016, what a shame
Pretty much every phone company now passes the RPI onto their customers, it seems to be standard practice now, not sure what changed!

You will be charged up until the 30 days notice ends when cancelled Sabrina. This should also be pro rata. -Zain
Great thanks for your help Zain!
The 80% likely refers to a data add-on you recently bought, Dr Davies. Your new month’s allowance won’t kick in until that’s all gone. -CT

Sad that you're cancelling Sabrina. The link has a list of all EE contact numbers for customer services. ...I only want it for my holiday :) I got it 2 days ago so if I give my 1 month notice I won't be charged for the following month will I?
@user Just got a phone call from your team, and the lady was so rude when I said I'm leaving to @user because of the data/price
basically she hung up on me... took me 2 days request the PAC Code from you, and thank god I did.... can't stand rude CS.
Hi there, I understand the frustration this has caused. May I ask if you had purchased an add-on prior to your normal allowance? - Mark J
Hello, my tariff turned to Pay As You Go this month and can't tell what my allowances are :( I thought it was 4gig
Hi Sabrina. This seems odd? Could you please contact the EE Tech support team, so we can check this for you. -Zain
I'm ringing EE in a bit to give my 30 days notice as I only want the mini for a month. Can you give me the free contact number please?
Only 6 weeks until I can say goodbye to my @user contract and get a much much cheaper contract with loads more data with @user Can't wait.
Been a customer with @user for 13 years. 2017 is the year I break it off and I jump into bed with @user .

We're always looking to add more destinations, so keep your  peeled as you never know where we might add in the future.
Your binge says 100+ channels via ukplayer
Hi Jason. Yes, TV Plus gives you extra channels, on top of the many more you get free. It totals over 100.Hi @user ! I currently pay £11.50 for unlimited texts, unlimited data and 350 minutes - is this something you could match? Thanks!
Hi  AYCE data starts at £28 on SIM. But you also get AYCE mins & texts, Feel at Home & Go Binge...Worst customer service I've ever had from @user - looking to move providers ASAP. Any recommendations?
Thanks Anna! @user - let us know if you have any questions 
@user  how much is the all you can eat data ??
Hi there, it depends on the plan and phone that you choose... Take a look in our Store for options:Hi @user I got a Ratuken code via the  app but I can't see where to enter it and now I can't see code again on the app?
Hi, sorry for the delay. The in app chat support should be able to help you with this 
The fact that they liked this is worrying..
Just showing that we understand that it was a bit ridiculous

We're here to help. How long is it taking for your plan to load? Also, what device, OS and version of the app are you using?
i've logged out and created a new account, and it's working snappy again. I'm pretty sure it has to do with syncing lots of Google Fit stuff
seems like it never actually finished loading. Using a Nexus 6P, Android 7.1.2, NTC v5.5.3. it seems like it gets bogged by session end

Sony xperia XE, ya des instalé e instalé la app y ahora no funciona bien el GPS marca la mitad de lo que hago.
it's just so slow, like every time I switch a screen or bring up history it has to check with some server to find the information ->
That information should be ON MY PHONE, especially if I just finished a run. it shouldn't need to handshake with your site to show my run.

Get back to us once you complete the run. Also, do you have the Activity app open while using the NRC app? (2/2)
But it doesn't seem like that should be necessary.  I can do that if that's the recommendation, but, that's not intuitive.
Get back to us once you complete the run. Also, do you have the Activity app open while using the NRC app? (2/2)
I did run last night successfully, turned on watch NRC but didn't hit start, turned on phone NRC coach, hit start, and it seemed to work....
Get back to us once you complete the run. Also, do you have the Activity app open while using the NRC app? (2/2)
After I start running and phone starts tracking, the watch suddenly turns on NRC and logs too. I'd think it would auto-synch but it doesn't
Get back to us once you complete the run. Also, do you have the Activity app open while using the NRC app? (2/2)
No, I don't have the activity app open during the run.  I just have it on the main screen, don't touch it and only open NRC from phone. (1/2
Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
I don't quite care so much about the bad logging, but I do want to look at my watch during a run and see my stats, while hearing Coach
Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
Is there a particular sequence I need to start a coach run in, if I have both watch and phone with me?

Just to clarify, do the runs look correct in the NRC app?
The runs in NRC looked how they did in the Apple Activity log, however, I was able to delete the wrong log in there to clean it up.
Thank you for the screenshots. Just to clarify, are your phone and watch synced via Bluetooth?
Yes
You're only able to apply runs to the current week of your Coach plan. Let us know if we can assist with anything else.
Thats great, thank you 
Select the run in Activities> click on edit> click on my plan> apply it to the schedule in your Coach plan> save. How'd it go?
It worked thank you! Had no idea I could do that, I couldn't add last weeks but can do it from now on. Appreciate your speedy support cheers

Hey there, please reach out to us via: and we will have this checked for you. ^KS
Still haven't received. No word from @user no call. What's happening, guys?  on PS4. Went to the store. It's sold out everywhere so had to return and repurchase on your site.
Got it - I hope the next one comes in perfect condition! ^Heidi
Can @user bill be paid with a Discover CC?
Hey - You might want to double check with @user but typically we would accept cash or a check in stores. ^Heidi
so the best thing would be to go back to the store?
Which platform did you purchase that for? ^Heidi
Thanks! Looking forward to your reply.
Okay! Because these are considered Gift Cards, we cannot price match them. I apologize! ^Heidi

Can I have the email of an actual person please?
As Derek provided - Twitter@BestBuy.com will reach our team. ^Heidi
I need to talk to a person who can help me with a problem above and beyond your policy. You sold me a $1000 stove that is leaking gas.
You are more than welcome to email us so we can get the correct teams involved. ^Heidi
so the best thing would be to go back to the store?
I would say so. Otherwise you can try and contact the manufacturer as well. ^Heidi
the thing is, none of the stores near me have any extra stock of sonic mania according to the website.
They might be able to order one in for you. ^Heidi
it's missing the battery cover underneath the statue.
Uh oh! I would recommend to revisit the store as soon as you can and speak with a manager about this. ^Heidi
@user I did an online order/store pick up yesterday and found my 10% birthday coupon this morning. Is there anyway retroactively redeem?
Hi! I really wish there was a way! You would need to return the order and re purchase it with the coupon. ^Heidi
@user I renewed my Gamers Club Unlocked online, it says it's "ready for download" but my subscription hasn't been renewed...
Hey there, Sorry about any troubles - The activation can take up to one week to fully process. ^Heidi
Yo @user called support, no help. Someone broke into your online system and used my CC on file to try to order. That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted your bank to report it? In the meantime I would recommend to change your online password.^Heidi
Thanks for your help! We will check it out and hopefully find the perfect one

Greetings Matthew, That is not what we want to hear. Could you share with us what happened? ^Ken
Any idea when it's going to be sold again. I'd order online but Best Buy charges ridiculously high for shipping?
Regretablly, we do not have info on availability. I would be best to keep an eye on our website for any updates. ^Ken
@user is the worst. Promised me a delivery and installation today from 4-8. Never got it. After confirmation from 3 diff employees Oh no, that doesn't seem right. Were you given an explanation for the no show? ^Ken
@user the time window that ur driver lost his keys and you'll call me to reschedule? No thanks that's UNACCEPTABLE. Coming to you @user Chuck, That is disappointing to hear. Did you get a chance to speak with a store manager? ^Ken
Went to 2 stores. No steel book, Ken. Alien Covenant.

Being an Elite Plus Member doesn't feel all that special. 800 customer service said take it up with the store manager. I hung up on them.
Roku specifically calls out those two as supported services in all their materials.
I appreciate your help! Unfortunately, Roku support has been pretty pathetic, which is why I reached out to you guys. Will try them again.
It's possible the current software does not support these two streaming services. You may need to connect back with Roku for resolution.^Tea

He says geek squad can't come out anytime soon. They're totally backed up. He offered me a small credit and now I'm stuck.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
The manager said the guy who sold it to me was seasonal and six months ago when he worked there that's how it worked.
We are not happy to hear that. What seems to be going on? ^Ken
Long story short I bought a tv told that it would be delivered and set up and the guys came dropped off the tv in the box and left.
I would be upset too and concerned. Has this been leaking the entire time that you are aware of? ^Alison
It has been leaking since it was installed. Best Buy should make an exception on 15 day returns for defective items. Put customers first.
Oh no, I can imagine the disappointment of the backorder on your item. We apologize for the inconvenience. ^Ken
Thanks Ken it was just bad timing

The best I've been told is to wait 24-48 hours and call back to see the deal. Most likely going to cancel my order and purchase elsewhere.
Are your orders in a Pending Cancellation status or the authorizations on your credit card? ^Tea
Pending cancellation
Oh dear! That's quite a lot. Can you please confirm your full name and email address via DM for verification? I'd like to review this. ^JD
Let me know what you find, yet another email duplicate as of 5:44pm ET
I can't say for sure as this is outside policy, but you could speak with a manager at the store about this matter. ^JD
Ok. Thanks!

Hi there, can you send us your order number and delivery address in a private message please? Thanks, Megan.
Cannot look at product descriptions when going through lists of various products. Might be local chrome or IE settings maybe?
Sometimes our website doesn't work on mobile devices just in case you're on that, we do have an app that should help. Megan.
And will it be at that price on its return to store?
.. can take our IT team a few days to remove the product from our site. Holly 2/2
And will it be at that price on its return to store?
Ah sorry, I didn't realise the product is priced to clear. This means we won't be getting the item back in stock. It..1/2
@user is there an issue with your website at the moment?
Hey Philip, I haven't been made aware of any issues recently. What problem are you having? Megan.
Why do @user advertise sold out items on website? Surely it's not a ploy to make disappointed customers buy dearer items? Flymo Glider 350
Sorry Tess, we still advertise sold out products, as they will be coming back in to stock in the future. Holly
No, I bought it in store a few days ago.
If you return to store with your receipt, the team there will be able to sort this out for you. Mark
@user  glitch in their system and that my only recourse is to have a refund (which takes 5 days). Non-existent customer service!!

b&qcustomerservices@b-and-q.co.uk. Megan.

Who's going to foot the bill, Valspar? @user @user @user 3/3
Hi Chris, could you send us a private message please? James.
I will pack up the tiles ready for you to arrange collection.
Unfortunately we don't offer collections of goods that were collected in store. You'd need to speak to the store about this.
The house as I was late for work. A courtesy call to say he wasn't able to make it would have been perfect!
I'll feed this back to the Aintree store, apologies for the inconvenience caused by this Nicole. Megan.
I didn't go to store-appointment made to come to house and price up bathroom@9am. I called several times, no one gave me a straight answer

Unfortunately this is not something we can do Andy. James.

Hi Martyn, can you send a private message so we can discuss this further?. @user @user thanks for advertising products that are not available. 9 out of 9 unavailable  Sorry, not all the products online are available in every store, but if they're not on clearance they should be restocked. Leigh
Look into this? I've put it on my table so what do I do whilst they look into it?
Since you bought this in store, it's down to them to discuss an exchange or refund, if the product is considered faulty. Leigh
@user Pretty irate. Waited in 8 hrs on 2 days for delivery due on 4th. No calls from you, still no goods. On hold 40 mins.Disgusted.

Sorry Angus! Did you buy in store or online? Please send more info via the link.Sorry about that Ellie, my colleagues in store may have meant that it was discontinued in the Grantham store. Holly
Not exactly good when your staff send customers elsewhere & don't know what they can sell, could have ordered it in for us or said go online
Sorry about that Ellie, my colleagues in store may have meant that it was discontinued in the Grantham store. Holly
Well considering they said no it's a discontinued paint at b&q and sent us to Homebase I don't think they meant in store.
Sorry about that Luke, was this purchased online or in store? Holly
Hi Sam, it was ordered through tradepoint
@user why are we told this paint is discontinued yet you sell it online??? Now going to have to order & wait even longer! Not helpfulpic.twitter.com/VA19qmppDQ

Hi Pete i'm so sorry about this please click here for one of our agents to look in to this for you - Shannon
It's bloody useless is what it is. Fikile was in no mood to help, obviously busy on his other chat.  With two chats it can take some time to respond. We do appreciate patience and understanding. I would advise you call in. - Abby

I really do apologise Ashley. Would you be available to chat about this in the morning over Live Chat so we can resolve this? - Abby
it won't let me DM your account??
My mistake! I'm sorry.. I am now following you. - Abby
Ok thankyou. How do I request this? I went to "contact us" but couldn't see a phone number or email
This is our Customer Services Freephone :) - 0800 092 3355 - Abby

Hi Nicola, you can request this to be sent to you as a cheque :) - Abby

Hi Ashley, that is ridiculous! I am so sorry.. did they give you a reason as to why this has been cancelled? - Abby
@user 1 and 1/2 hours waiting to speak to someone on live chat still no joy , they too busy playing with my credit limit to do chats
Hi Baz, we do currently have availability on the chat here is the link. - Abby
@user struggling to log in tonight, are you having issues, I've tried via the app and URL.
Hi, I've not heard anything regarding these troubles.. very odd. Is it an issue with the app or just the log-in? - Abby
I've tried that no live chat
The option will become available when an advisor is available. - Abby
I'm going to send backwhats arrived & close account a absolute waste of time today trying to sort out & no one seems to know what's going on
I'm sorry to hear this Leila, If there is anything we can do here on Twitter please don't hesitate to let me know. - Abby
Please do. If you can get to the bottom of it, you'll be the only helpful person today! Fingers crossed.
Could you please DM me so I can discuss this further.. I won't be a moment I assure you :) - Abby
I speak to the rude people in South Africa all the time
I do apologise Ceejay, if you pop to our Live Chat we can help there.. - Abby
After having an advice note saying my items had been delivered, having 2 items missing, lots of phones calls. Turns out items weren't sent!
I'm sorry to hear this Layla. Has this now been rectified? - Abby
This is what I ordered? I didn't see an option to tick at check out -but i want pay for it over 12 months Can you correct this for me??pic.twitter.com/0HNqMQcMan

I cant get through
I do appreciate it is a little busy at the moment. I assure you our advisors are working hard to get chats :) - Abby
It's a pressure cooker. Please don't tell me you'll get me a courier or to go on a Live Chat...

Hi Georgina, unfortunately however we can't access accounts on Twitter so we would direct you to Live Chat but we do need to contact the...
@user absolutely horrendous service! Spent hours trying to sort out their cock up! What a nightmare!
Hi Leila, I'm sorry to hear this! Is there anything I can do hear to help? - Abby
and why haven't you given me my money back? Why is this taking so long to sort out?
Hi Scott, please PM me so I can discuss this in further detail (limited with characters on tweets) - thank you, Abby
@user I need to change my address on my account but it's a new build and not coming up with postcode. Nowhere to input it directly
Hi Lauren, may I ask how long you've had your account for? - Abby
Yes she helped me on chat, advised i could get a like 4 like and now callcentre are saying i have to wait out for the part to come. Confused
Amy is currently unavailable at the moment. However we do have other fab team members on chat at the moment :) - Abby
Ok - ill try that.
Here is our link if you are happy to wait :) - Abby
You can tell. It's obviously not a dedicated service.
We appreciate that feedback. However on Social Live Chat we have a few less barriers when it comes to process.. but it is busy at the moment
If there aren't any managers no wonder the agents think they can treat customers badly
There are managers however they aren't always available for escalations as we have a specialist team who would do this. - Abby
Really? Who is it with? Via the complaints area on your website.
Yes, we at Social Media have our own Live Chat and the one on the website is based elsewhere, so we operate a little differently :) - Abby
The live chat is useless. Why dont you have dedicated customer service? Ive emailed in, you claim 24 hour response but that was 3 days ago
This Live Chat is a different one to the one on the website. How did you submit this email? Through the form or the app? - Abby
@user still no call from a manager.  I have a major complaint
Hi Ceejay, may I ask what this is regarding? - Abby
@user I ordered something over £300 I thought I could pay it within 12 months so why isn't it asking me pay a part of it now? xx
Hi Kelly, did the option for Buy Now Pay Later come up at all ? - Abby
I am once again at a stumbling block, could amy get in touch please. I have had enough of this  Call centre are useless and wont replace
Hi Steph, I'm so sorry to hear! you're looking to get a hold of Amy are you? - Abby
No, a price match for a sofa thats price has dropped within the two week window.
Hi Pete, ok. Our live chat is a little busy at the moment. Would you prefer to wait or email in? - Abby
Again, useless link.pic.twitter.com/UPV3JVbc0h
I do apologise you can't instantly be put through to an advisor. We are working to get through to those waiting as fast as we can. - Abby
It's really busy but I'll keep trying for sure. Been hung up on over the phone
It does get busier towards the evenings I am afraid :( Thank you for your understanding we look forward to hearing from you - Abby
@user well done to the team at Very, brand new washing machine arrives so wet it's damaged!!!pic.twitter.com/gEu6Uus4D7
Hi Paul, I am sorry to hear this! Please head to our Live Chat so we can look into this further for you. - Abby
sorted thank you,quick question, it said that if already despatched that you can tell the delivery driver to take it back, is this true
We can request this, but it may be too late as it could be out for delivery. But you can also refuse at the door and it'd be returned - Abby
Nope, had no idea it'd been cancelled until i tracked the package and got that text.
This sometimes happens if the item is found to have been damaged in its transit. We can look into this though. Abby
@user 5 days, no refund. No sense from your customer service and no answer on here.  nah, Hi Pete, I'm sorry to hear this! May I ask if this is in regards to a return? - Abby
Seriously, I'm at my wits' end. 3 times they've said a courier will come & collect. 3 times they haven't! Grrr.....
Hi Georgina, I'm sorry to hear this! May I ask what the item is please?: - Abby
@user please help, it says I've cancelled my order but I haven't???

I am sorry to hear of the service you have experienced. How have you contacted out Web Chat Team, via the website? Thanks Rach
I have already contacted very and been told yodel will deliver on Saturday now, 1 week later due to yet another yodel delay!!,

Hi Lauren, I'm afraid we aren't told what's coming in the next update. However I will pass your comment on :) Hello,

Expecting it via email.

Thank you
Hi Mikey! It should appear in your email pretty quickly. Have you checked your spam/junk folder? @user hey, my order says that it's been signed for delivered but I've been out all day and can't see my package in any safe places?!
Hi Danielle! Please can you DM us your order number so we can have a look for you? :) Jesus! What is with the @user @user site??? Sorry about this :( Our site is still being updated so hopefully this will improve shortly! Thank you for your patience  @user how long does it take for an e-gift card to be delivered?
Hi Mikey,

Are you expecting this via email or post?

Best wishes,

Been a size 12 in @user jeans since I was 14, Why can I barely fit my new ones over my ankle?! And no I haven't got any fatter 
Hi Laura, We are keen to hear more about this! Please can you DM me your email address and the product numbers of the jeans :)
Can you send me a link to the dress in the second picture please? I can't find it on the website
Hi Holly! The product code for this dress is 539100901 - Just pop this in the search bar on our website! @user is there anything you can do passed 28 days? Items are obviously tagged, unused and in packaging etc (2/2).
Hi! Could you please DM us your order number so we can help? :) @user hi, why is my order arriving with standard delivery when I spent over £100 and quality for express delivery?
Hey Kerri! Could you DM us your order number so we can have a look? Really disappointed with my button on my bag completely falling off after having this for only two months.  @user Tia! Could you please send these over to me in a DM so I can look into this for you :) G3 6JQ (or DD3 9RD as my mum can check!) 530849240 in a 12 if poss!
Hi Kirsty I have had a look at stores local to both of these areas and unfortunately I cannot find the jeans at all Would you be able to let me know if anything changes please?
No problem Katie, pop back in a few days and we'll have another look! Really?! The tag says new arrivals though 
That is a very good point, it is possible that they aren't on our restock system yet! @user is it possible to check store stock for a sale item? The size I ordered is a bit too small but no size up available online!
Hi Kirsty! I can certainly have a look! Please DM us with your postcode and the product number Just bought the same jeans from @user as I did not two weeks ago and they don't fit, sort out your sizes sick of this now
Please can you DM me with your email and the jeans you have tried so we are able to pass the feedback across for you.
I appreciate that, but when your sized items go to an 18, I'm pretty sure a L wouldn't cover that. Those items also aren't avail. in curve.
Hi Sam! I completely understand your frustration and I will be sure to pass your comments onto the Design Team! Ok, so not everything. But the first two items I opened were. It's infuriating.
Hi Sam, 
With some of our items these are flexible with their sizes, they cover more sizes such as S=8-10.
These in a size 6, tried every store in my area since last week and they would be perfect for my friends wedding on Saturday pic.twitter.com/6aDtykmwUP
Hi Katie, I am really sorry it doesn't look like we are getting those back  Thanks, Is there any sort of tracking number for UK mail that I can get my hands on?
Sorry but it looks like they haven't provided us with one! :(

Hi Rebecca, once you have got to the checkout and chose your delivery option, it should take off the delivery charge When you return a parcel via collect plus do you have to include the receipt in the package?
Hi Ramona, As long as you have included thereturns slip, no receipt is required :) @user Hi Paige, please could you pop these photos over to us in a direct message? @user did you get rid of the saved items on the new app? I loved that feature 
Hey Lauren! Our app is still new and being worked on, this feature should hopefully appear in a future update! :) That's quite a challenge with two children!
Yes of course no problem. Please can you DM me the product number that's in the label :) Sorry! Fashion crisis averted. I used another another browser and it worked! Order is on its way. Thanks.

Yes of course :) Please DM me the product number, and your postal address and I can look into this for you :) Have done 
.@newlookhelp please can you tell me where my order is? And why you use Hermes who are less than useless?  V v angry.
Hermes is the worst delivery firm ever. Procurement managers hire them to keep costs low but the customer experience is crap. False economy
Oh no, I am sorry this has happened to your t-shirt. Please take it back to the store and you can get full refund :) Thanks! 
Oh crumbs! That's not what you want! Yes you are more than welcome to return the shoes Thank you
Hi Holly can you please DM me with your email address and billing address so that I can have a look at your account? done!
Hi there, I am really sorry you feel this way. Not the experience I was expecting from New Look, clearly volume orders are more important than customer service.
Hi Holly! Can you please send me a screenshot of the error that you have received? Thanks I get this from trying to use Paypal and my debit card - I tried both :/pic.twitter.com/BzXDxWNEkf
Can you DM me a screen shot of the error message and your Bag ID (By secure check out button) Extremely disappointed with how this matter has been handled. I shall be returning the whole order and requesting a refund on my annual pass

Finger crossed! :) None left :-(

@user hi I just ordered something from your website and I accidentally made a mistake when typing my email address but didn't realise
until I ordered it so now I won't be able to get the confirmation email? And they usually ask for it when you collect in store
Ah that's so annoying. Will keep fingers crossed for you! Are there any other companies you can write to?
Hopefully, it's just trying to find them. My mum suggested writing to @user as it's local. I'm not so sure.
Hi Lovely! I don't think they are :( If you DM me your post code I can look nearer to you BB104SL  is there any way of getting the Liverpool/Preston pair to my local store if not?? X

Shit I'm only concerned about the marvel tv shows lol. Fuck the movies
Marvel TV shows are not impacted by the recent Disney news!
I really hope @user moving to @user doesn't mean the end of  or I'll cry for days 
this deal doesn't impact existing ABC/Shonda shows at all. It just means future, as-yet-unknown Shonda shows will be Netflix originals!
This means Grey's Anatomy is staying in Netflix forever? YAS!
well technically this deal only impacts *future* Shonda shows. But yes Grey's needs to go on for at least 100 more years
Come on now how am I supposed to watch @user 
This is crazy no warning 
Ok Shonda Rihmes pic.twitter.com/RX5fIVKT5U
don't worry, Scandal/Grey's/HTGAWM aren't going anywhere. this deal applies to future Shondaland shows!
Would Shonda Rhimes moving to Netflix mean that the shows on ABC are ENDING?! Please say no!
nope! all the ABC favorites will keep thriving on ABC (and some of them stream on Netflix as well). this deal is about FUTURE Shondaland 
WOW! GO Shonda!! I'm actually scared, idk if I could survive binging Shondalandnot gonna lie, binge watching Scandal is a physically demanding experience
You guys should sell that as a premium add-on tier
would customers also be interested in a keepsake wine glass the size of Kerry Washington's head? asking for a friend
Netflix has signed a multiyear deal with Shonda Rhimes - poaching her from ABC. Story on @user coming soon
in other news, Netflix subscriptions will now come with a free month's supply of red wine.

So @user are we not going to get Luke Cage, Daredevil, Iron Fist or Jessica Jones anymore?
The Defenders are still on the way. Our Marvel series aren't affected by this news at all.
This move by Disney better not affect my  Netflix shows.  This news has no impact on our Marvel series.
@user how is this  news gonna affect your marvel tv shows--HOW?!?!?!
Not at all, this news does not impact our Marvel series.
Disney is ending @user deal and launching its own streaming service pic.twitter.com/84nN8ldtm0
This won't impact our Marvel series.
Just hearing this. They aren't pulling the @user + @user stuff are they?
Nope, the news you're seeing today does not impact our Marvel series.

Sorry about this! Drop us a DM with your order number, name and address. Beth

I am sorry we have let you down on this occasion and for any disappointment caused. Beth

Our Indigo brand. However, don’t worry – you’ll be able to buy similar products and trends across our other ranges...

Our customers told us there were too many brands in store and it often got confusing. Therefore, we’ve taken the decision to discontinue...

@user @user @user Thanks for your lovely comments!
Not complaining. Couldn't care less. Joke.
Hmm...  Jokes clearly lost on me then as I still fail to see any humour in it.  If you say so though.
Apologies! Please take your receipt/packaging to store so this can be sorted for you.
Was this morning  receipt & sandwich are in the trash.Full of egg shells, not a little piece. What if was for child? Not acceptable!!!
I'm fine, rather I was just finding it utterly ridiculous that someone could complain of an item not being replaced but having more variety.
Not complaining. Couldn't care less. Joke.
Do you want to go and have your overreaction festival somewhere else? Because it's weird and boring.
I'm fine, rather I was just finding it utterly ridiculous that someone could complain of an item not being replaced but having more variety.
I fail to see how complaining about "pandering" to people with different tastes and/or allergies is a joke, but fine if you say so.

Our whips are so good, Jack ;)
During my pre plant based eating days, I loved your walnut whips!

Any chance of a dairy free version..... 
I fail to see how complaining about "pandering" to people with different tastes and/or allergies is a joke, but fine if you say so.
If you failed to see the tongue in cheek you may need to locate your sarcasm gene. As a person with life threatening allergies, I got it.
Will have to try these, love salted caramel.
They're close to perfection but the walnut ones still edge it for me. Have to say all by @user and no I'm not being paid by them
Dear @user I hope you will be retaining the Walnut on your Walnut whips 
always defending the walnuts, @user - and rightly so!
It was a joke. I genuinely couldn't care less.
I fail to see how complaining about "pandering" to people with different tastes and/or allergies is a joke, but fine if you say so.

"Oh no they're keeping what I like but adding extra types?!  I must complain!"
It was a joke. I genuinely couldn't care less.
Pander?  Bitch, nut allergies are a thing, how the feck is it pandering that they want to widen their potential customers?
"Oh no they're keeping what I like but adding extra types?!  I must complain!"
I resent the new ones though. Walnut whips for people who don't like walnuts. We shouldn't pander to them. Where will it end?
Pander?  Bitch, nut allergies are a thing, how the feck is it pandering that they want to widen their potential customers?
THEY DO! And they're so good 
I need to get some of those! Perhaps I'll treat myself this Friday

@user I've lost my manual for my JL100 sewing machine :( any chance you have a pdf or paper copy you could send please? :)
Hi Sarah. Sorry to hear this! :( Can you confirm it's the JL100 model? - Martin
Then why does the JL website say "once the guarantee has expired" bit confusing?
Can you link us to the page where you see this, Laura? - Martin
Thank you for your response.
No problem! Have a lovely night, Sasha. - Martin
@user re JL guarantee this says buying 'added' care covers repairs after guarantee ends... does it mean I get 4 yrs total on a camera?pic.twitter.com/4EXzYIWiJ4
Hey Laura! :) No. Added care runs alongside your product warranty, it doesn't extend it! - Martin
Norwich. I even said I wanted to buy today. Asked to compare 10.5 & 9.7 side by side. Said can't do it and walked off then no service.

Sorry you left the shop feeling disappointed Michelle. Do you wish to speak with anyone from the team regarding the item? - A

Sorry to read this John. Did the other partner speak to you about your concerns? - Jenna
No. She just said 'it's one of those days for her' really was poor!

Do I get a 4 year warranty on my new camera as a reward? 
We now expect Apple Pay to be available for the partnership card in late 2016 or early 2017 ~ Adrienne.
This is becoming farcical - why can't @user just be honest and say we're not doing it.
And this one too, says "added care to ensure your peace of mind lasts even longer"It all reads like Added Care adds 2yrs to JL guarantee + accidental = 4yrs.
Hi Sarah. Sorry to hear this! :( Can you confirm it's the JL100 model? - Martin
Yup that's it. Bought as a wedding present ten years ago!
Can you link us to the page where you see this, Laura? - Martin

Long story but basically involved me standing there for 15/20mins being completely ignored then being referred to as "a wee girl"
That's bang out  woulda asked to have spoken to a manager
Still broken. Probably best if you stick to the shops and leave the internet a bit tidier please.
@user - Site still broken. Wasted a furtther 15 mins reporting the technical issue - Guess what? That failed too. Waste of time.
TRIPLE TONE Get an ombre lip in one swipe! Now available from our studio stores, @user and @user this in my life

What happened?
Long story but basically involved me standing there for 15/20mins being completely ignored then being referred to as "a wee girl"
get a new prescription "just in case". Of what? A need to wear glasses for cosmetic reasons? 

Or another case of Boots milking the NHS?
Hard to say for sure without performing the test. 20/20 is average vision. New prescription may make vision clearer - or more comfortable
Please dm us your telephone number, post code & email and will see what we can find on your account. Many thanks.
Already spoken 2 your cs dept w no help.T'was gift & no proof of purchase available.Perhaps u shud learn frm @user who put customer 1st

Bad, bad pun.
Not just tampons, every sanitary 'ladies' product. Which according to the tax man and is a 'luxury item' needs to be banned is unfair.
Imagine thinking periods are a luxury?  even being near a lass whilst there on is painful sometimes, can't imagine having to go through it
It's a bloody disgrace ! They have a tampon tax
It certainly is, but sanitary products are apparently luxury items. Needs to be banned. But good on Tesco and others for paying it for us.
mind blown
Scone blown

7.50 delivery! - even though I've driven from Blackpool to the store and no where does it say online exclusive. So unhappy
Hi, It does say delivery only and item may be available to order at Warrington on line  - Liam
How can it be in store but then not available there? At all ever? So annoyed.
This is an optional product that the store choose not to sell i'm afraid - Liam
No one evident to speak to.
We will pass this over to the store please send over your details in a DM if you wish them to contact you -Yes but they have not offered any practical or reasonably priced solution.
Please DM us what they have said - Katie-Lou
So it'll never be in stock in store? I've been all the way from Blackpool for it :(
Hi, unfortunately we don't have any plans for this to be a store item at present. Really sorry about that - Tasha
Would you like to DM us the details so we can look into this for you? ThanksI have DM you.

We have plenty of these in stock. Aisle 3, location 1 :) - Katie-Lou
Define:  "Plenty"?  The last time I was told there were "plenty" of something in a shop, I had to wait a month for stock to be delivered?
This is very strange. Are you able to try a different device? Thanks, Stacey

We were confused as you said store-finder.Do you mean stock-finder?Please tell me the article number so we can check for you and the store?
601.113.40 at Glasgow.
Not sure why this has happened Phil. I have just tried this myself with no issues. Can you try refreshing or a different browser? Thanks, SG
Just tried both, neither worked...
No. I was just told to wait. My item is to be collected from Stratford Westfield collection centre.
I've submitted a cancellation yesterday but as it may be more than 14 days since estimated delivery I'm not sure I'm getting a full refund?
Hi, have you spoken to Parcel Force about this? - Tasha
No. I was just told to wait. My item is to be collected from Stratford Westfield collection centre.
This is not great to hear but thank you for the feedback, we will pass it on! Thanks, Stacey
Now being told 1 item not available online when elsewhere on website it says that it is. You will be lucky to sell me anything at this rate.pic.twitter.com/n81YLz3MjB

Thanks for letting us know. When placing the order, the slot isn't guaranteed. I will feed this on though in case there was an error - KL
When delivery is so expensive at £35, I'm annoyed at being messed about. Please can you see if you can arrange a refund for delivery costs?
Thanks for letting us know. When placing the order, the slot isn't guaranteed. I will feed this on though in case there was an error - KL
That's all she said "it's an error". I've now booked a £45 train ticket home for the morning thinking that was the delivery time?!
Waiting for my basket to unlock following a timeout during checkout. Previous order took 3 attempts to actually get delivered.
Your processes could be slicker, would be my feedback. I seem to spend a lot of time on webchat & the phone with you recently.
Oh no! Is there anything we can help with? - Tasha
Waiting for my basket to unlock following a timeout during checkout. Previous order took 3 attempts to actually get delivered.

It depends on which fronts you've got as it may be that you have the wrong attachments - Katie-Lou
I think there is a fundamental design flaw with Behjälplig, the plastic clips aren't strong enough to support doors.
It depends on which fronts you've got as it may be that you have the wrong attachments - Katie-Lou
This was the attachment recommended by your kitchen designers?
Do you have an IKEA dishwasher? If so which one? - Katie-Lou
No i have a Bosch - I don't think you need a Behjälplig adapter for an IKEA dishwasher?

Your online reps just say "oops, sorry." But this is BS. Your website NOW prices my flight even LESS than what I was supposed to pay.
And, allows offerings in out of the way locations, where there are no traditional hotels. Realize that's not response to issues in Banff...

you always sending me ' urgent deal now ' but there is NEVER ACTUALLY A DEAL ! @user strange way to attract biz
Their point system is a joke too.
I'm genuinely curious about this, because I don't know about it. What kinds of marketing?
Mostly bait and switch online advertising. ie. quoting a lower prices associated to property images than they really are.
And moreover, I've had a great experience with Air bnb. Found accommodations I wouldn't otherwise have found. Not just hotel rooms.
And, allows offerings in out of the way locations, where there are no traditional hotels. Realize that's not response to issues in Banff...
OTA's are also responsible for a 30% cancellation rate. Again a cause for inflated prices.

That's a fair point. But in my experience, the 3rd party price is usually the same or lower than direct booking. But, don't use that much.
OTA's employ gorilla marketing tactics.

Those OTA's ie. @user @user can be responsible for as much as 70% of bookings & command 15 - 25% commission. Inflating price.
Blame @user & @user for inflated hotel prices. Not the hoteliers. They are price drivers.

Unable or unwilling? Littlewoods makes money hand over fist. More than enough to not exploit the labour of Yodel's zero hours workforce.
Yodel is indisputably the worst delivery service in the country. Their drivers are overworked and underpaid. Look at the complaints.

Totally agree. I have a next account and they always let me pay on the 27th of the month. I don't understand how littlewoods can't do this.
